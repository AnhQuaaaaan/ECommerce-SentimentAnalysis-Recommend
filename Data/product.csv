B00837YY18,"Proraso Shaving Soap, Refreshing and Toning formula, is formulated for any skin or beard type and provides a rich, creamy lather to prepare skin for a close shave without nicks and cuts. Eucalyptus purifies and tones while menthol adds a refreshing, cooling sensation. Made with a special "hot soap" process, it\'s left to mature in small batches for 10 days, during which the moisture evaporates, and the product becomes solid and more concentrated -- perfect for a professional-quality shave with a brush. Cruelty-free, with 91% of ingredients of natural origins, and of course, theres no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oils, artificial colors or sodium laurel sulfate. Originating in Italy, Proraso has been helping men achieve a smooth shave since 1948. Over the years, our line of men\'s shaving products has become a staple of Italian culture, and evolved to feature natural-based formulations without mineral oils or artificial colors. Nourishing botanical extracts and natural oils protect the skin before, during and after shaving for an irritation-free experience.', '', 'You&#039;ll notice that our soap may take a bit more water than you&#039;re used to, in order to achieve the ideal lather. That&#039;s actually one of our biggest points of difference -- the result of its manufacturing process -- and what makes Proraso soap so special. Because it has a much lower moisture content than other shave soaps, youll need more water on your shaving brush (we&#039;d suggest soaking it for a few minutes prior to lathering), and perhaps just a touch more patience at first, to achieve that signature Proraso lather: rich, dense, elastic, and one that doesnt dry out. Once you do, youll really see the difference (and why its become such a staple of shaving culture over the last 6 decades).', '<img alt="" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/87f262ab-3bf0-48d8-9aa3-54c9e4b5bc19.png._CB272368817__SL220__.png">', '<img alt="" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/44e37be2-2e5a-4d6e-9ee6-9ed237bc8018.png._CB272368772__SL220__.png">', '<img alt="" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0318bd0e-6422-484a-92bf-1467348035dc.png._CB272368797__SL220__.png">', '<img alt="" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0ca5e5f0-2ac9-4c85-b34d-5e855eadc913.png._CB272369518__SL220__.png">', '<img alt="" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png">', '<img alt="" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/f7624cb7-05c3-4a88-a1b9-0b2579258dab.png._CB272368057__SL220__.png">', '<img alt="" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/418aea90-1bc0-49c8-bf50-923480cca268.png._CB272368033__SL220__.png">', '<img alt="" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/b826d55f-90b2-440f-aa38-21ffca0124bf._SL220__.png">', '<img alt="" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f3e86d43-4aa3-4e2d-a305-aa8c0ebb9dee._SL220__.png">', '<img alt="" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/3e3bc852-8a9b-4773-9e58-c080fa1b0dc7._SL220__.png">', '<img alt="" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/226de1cf-3c9b-4f8b-8bd5-18d9be733f71._SL220__.png">',",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cov5myDCL.jpg,"Proraso Shaving Soap in a Bowl, Refreshing and Toning, 5.2 oz",10
