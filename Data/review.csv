8,"i have sensitive skin and unfortunately have suffered painful reactions to certain brands of deodorant (mostly of the aluminum free or natural varieties from brands i otherwise like). i can't get enough of ck one and wanted to try this deodorant for a little while-so glad i did. definitely the ck one fragrance i adore but a little lighter/ more subtle, no skin irritation, long lasting (most surprising) and i'm happy with the results and experience of wearing it. smells fresh and clean which is what i want.",2016-07-22,5,3,A1EJ9DSKSM0UN1,B000068DWY

12,"i'm hard pressed to think of something more subjective to review than cologne. it's just one of those things you won't know if you like until you try it yourself. that said, i personally like this cologne. it has a nice, pleasant aroma that is not overpowering like other fragrances. my wife also likes the way it smells on me. i just use one spray on my neck - two seemed to be a bit too much.",2015-05-14,4,3,A32O98PFC3OP7K,B000068DWY
13,"one has been around for a while and while i used to wear calvin klein, i wore a different scent than this one but i really loved it. i do like the light, citrus scent of one and its versatility. it can be unisex and it isn't heavy or over bearing. this scent can also be wore during any season and night or day. i like the freshness of the smell because i dislike heavy perfumes-they can give me a headache and make me sneeze. one is a classic that never goes out of style. the price is reasonable and the scent will last though out the day or evening.

i like the aqua scent by calvin klein a bit more than one but i've been wearing them both and have gotten compliments on the fragrances.",2015-05-02,4,5,A6QG9LM5WL0AQ,B000068DWY
14,"i'm not one for scents or cologne, normally, however as the vine program offered this and it is billed for men or women, my wife and i decided to try it. the fragrance is clean and sophisticated but not overbearing and does indeed suit both men and women. amazon's price is still a little steep, coming from someone not into frangrances, but there is enough here to last a goodly while.",2015-05-01,5,4,AOP2ZRNSHY2Z3,B000068DWY
15,"this is one of the great modern classics.  i think every man (or woman apparently) should have a bottle of ck one in their arsenal.  out of the 20 fragrances i own, ck one is probably top two with aqua di gio essenza.  just a pleasing scent and one which some like but most will love.",2015-04-29,5,5,A2JP9E1H0SF392,B000068DWY
16,"ck one opens with a blast of pineapple and bergamot, and the sillage of an aircraft carrier.  about ten minutes in, the fruits yield to a heady rose, and for a moment the fragrance is heart-breakingly gorgeous.  but the rose fades quickly into the background with the other quiet florals.  grassy notes spring up, followed by a whisper of cardamom and the chypre of oakmoss.  after a while, the grasses fade and the cardamom quietens.  what's left is a mossy citrus.

this eau de toilette surprisingly lasts all day, and most people will find it pleasant.  it is a classic sort of fragrance, but not an outstanding one.  it is nice, but not memorable.  it's the kind of signature scent one wears if one wants to wear a signature similar to everyone else's.",2015-04-28,3,3,A3IOCPLIMYDBCD,B000068DWY
17,"picked this up for my husband who was looking for a fresh new scent to try. i love how the citrus and wood tones smell on him. i put a little on my wrist and the scent changed more than i expected. this is truly an adaptable scent.",2015-04-28,4,5,AG0830H1DBLD,B000068DWY
18,"the calvin klein ck one fragrance is marketed as gender neutral -- designed to be shared -- worn by either a man or woman. among many included components, the citrus and green notes definitely create a crisp and fresh fragrance but the other prominent scents are floral -- lily-of-the-valley, jasmine and rose. this is where there may be a problem selling it to both genders.

granted, so much of this is subjective  what we think smells good  so what may not work for one person is perfect for another, but for me, the florals are too noticeable. neither gender residing in the household liked the fragrance  the male definitely would not even consider using the product and the female disliked the noticeable lily-of-the-valley floral.

the visual presentation is understated and classic -- frosted glass fashioned into a classic bottle shape with a brushed silver-toned metal top and sprayer packaged in a simple white box featuring an embossed impression of the bottle. the spray is released in a very fine mist and because it is ea de toilette the fragrance strength is light. after an hour a small spray on my arm had almost completely dissipated -- little scent remained.

to create this gender-free scent, ingredients typically used in male fragrances are combined with components typically used in female fragrances. the idea of a unisex scent is not new, but successfully creating one that actually appeals to both genders requires balance. the end result of this fragrance stew is not unpleasant, but in my view is decidedly feminine.",2015-04-28,3,5,A35Q0RBM3YNQNF,B000068DWY
19,"calvin klein ck one is a scent that i first tried about 15 years ago when i was a teenager. i loved the scent then and i still like it now. it is unisex which means it can be used by men as a cologne or by women as a perfume. i tried it and so did my husband. i personally liked it better on me. his cologne that he wears is a lot stronger and more masculine. the ck one fell a little flat in comparison. i do love it as a perfume though. it smells sweet on my skin and the violets, jasmine and lilly scents really shine through.

the bottle that i received is 1.7oz. it is a decent size bottle that will last a long time...providing that you do not spill it. this comes to my one and only issue with this bottle. it has a screw on cap and no spray cap (like it shows in the picture). i am not sure if i received a box without the spray cap or if it just does not come with one. however, a spray top is necessary for me with fragrance. i have worn this 4-5 times already and i have already sloshed it all over my wrist once. frankly, i am a klutz and this would be a pricey spill if i knocked the entire bottle over.

the 1.7oz is the most expensive size that you can buy (currently $28.82 per ounce). the 6.7oz bottle for the current price of $69 is a steal ($10.30 per ounce!). however, that is a lot of perfume. i would only recommend buying that size if you know that you or your gift recipient really loves this perfume and will use it a lot. for me, this is an occasional perfume and the 1.7oz size will last me for years. the 1.7oz is big enough size wise to make a decent gift for a loved one. so, use your discretion and knowledge of the individual you are buying for when purchasing.

i would recommend this perfume. i just hope that my bottle only having a screw top was an error and everyone else receives a spray bottle as pictured.",2015-04-27,4,3,A39WWMBA0299ZF,B000068DWY
20,"if you're into unique, subtle scents, calvin klein's ck one is for you. it reminds me of unisex fragrances that had their heyday in the 90s. it's spicey, with the merest hint of a floral. i like it for myself, as a non-girly change of pace for my usual perfume of choice.

22,"about 20 years ago (ugh feeling old), this was the perfume/cologne that the cool kids wore. i decided recently that it still smells pretty darn good and wanted to go retro like the secret hipster that i am. everyone in their 30s & 40s recognizes the scent even if they don't know exactly that it's ck1. my only complaint is that it can give me a headache. worth it.",2015-01-22,4,5,A2MS6GT9F0CB01,B000068DWY

46,"i have already ordered this product as well as opi's glittery silver, rust and gold sparkly nail polish.  the coverage is fantastic and i have found other sparkly clear coats to put over whatever color i'm using and that makes it even more glittery
in the sun.

the product above and all the other opi sparkly nail polish give terrific coverage with just two coats.  it is thick and sometimes i add a smidgeon of polish remover to make it less 'coarse' while preserving the fantastic color with a little more ease.
i would definitely give a 'go' to the blue, rust, gold and silver sparkly colors

if you like glitter and you love sparkly you've gotta' try these products!!

this is one of the few polishes that i always get compliments on. it's one of those polishes that catch the eye. definitely my #1 holy grail red. if anything, i can probably say it's my favorite polish in my collection.",2017-06-11,5,5,A28BA1RUNCWUNZ,B000142FVW

(i also like revlon, which has similarly smooth formulas with good coverage and a large selection of colors.) i've never had an opi polish streak, clump, or lose "hairs" from the brushes (like with other polish brands), and the colors are rich and gorgeous.

this polish is my new favorite neutral. it's opaque and matte, with just the usual nail polish shine, but no shimmer or glitter. the color is a nice rosy mauve that's somewhere between pink and brown. it's a good year-round color for my pale, olive-toned skin, and i can imagine it might be flattering on many skin tones. i had hoped it might be slightly more purple, but although there seems to be a lavender undertone the overall color is more pink/mauve.",2016-12-28,5,5,A3PPEJY11SIL3Z,B000142FVW

186,"i have light skin with some imperfections. as i age, i find that my skin tone is uneven, and i have capillaries that are visible as well as some dark spots on my face. i wasn't quite sure how this product would work for me.

it comes with a spatula, but instead i moistened my fingertips and applied it as i would my normal foundation. i was quite surprised and impressed by the coverage as i blended it. since it comes hardened in the jar it was not as easy to apply as a liquid is, but warming it with the fingers seemed to help the spread. i dotted it and blended on my brown spots and it didn't seem to cake but looked fairly natural. i was very pleased with the outcome.

so why only 4 stars -- well, the truth is that the hard product in the jar isn't that easy to use. i didn't use the "scoop" and just twirled my fingers in the jar. it would be easy to overdo this. it is essential to get the right color for your skin and there is a handy chart on the website to use. i was thinking that a sponge might help with application, but i find that those just waste a lot of product. i also use a powder to set it. it is definitely thicker than my usual make-up and it's important to apply thinkly to avoid the "caked-on" look.

i find that this full coverage cover creme is the ultimate product for achieving the look of complete uniformity in facial skin color.  this product is heavier than other choices, and i use it in combination with, and under, liquid foundation and then face powder (also both dermablend).  despite this being a pretty intense trio of facial products, the end result looks natural while totally covering my most unnatural and varied actual skin tones.

this is definitely a keeper, and a product that i will purchase again, make up tends to last me a very long time!

to apply, i just rub my fingers over the powder to 'warm and soften' it, i find this much easier than using the little spatula that was included.  i suppose this is not the clean way of applying the foundation, but it works for me and my face has not broken out in a rash of acne or fallen off, so i will continue to ignore the little spatula, which always gets lost anyway!",2017-08-28,5,5,A5U5T6EWH90O0,B00014GT8W
205,"medium/full coverage foundations can be tricky.  it's hard to find that balance between covering up any imperfections without makeup looking cakey or unnatural.  this foundation from dermablend impressed me because it strikes that balance.  it's great for covering blemishes or other imperfections.

i applied it using the directions on dermablend's website.  the suggest starting with a small amount of product, warming it up with your fingertips to make the product more bendable, and then tapping it directly over your imperfections.  they state you can use multiple layers by allowing one layer to dry and applying more, but thankfully one layer has been perfect for me.  then you finish things off by applying setting powder, allow to set for 2 minutes then brush off excess powder with a brush.  dermablend makes its own setting powder but i don't own it so i've been setting my makeup with laura mercier and hourglass's powders instead, and have liked the results with both.

i still think i prefer lighter coverage for everyday wear, especially since i'm in my 30's and self-conscious about not accentuating fine lines or dryness.  but i really like this for nights out when i tend to wear bolder makeup.  it compliments a bold lip or smokey eye well.

207,"this review will be done from the perspective of a makeup artist.  i am going to explain how i find it is best to apply and use this foundation based upon the formula, and then how i think that this performs compared to other products that i have used over time.

what is this foundation like?
first of all, this is a very thick creme foundation.  this type of foundation is different in performance and application than lotion, powder, or mineral foundation.  more on that later.  the foundation comes in a clear jar with cap on it.  there is no scent,, and it is highly pigmented.

color?
i have compared this to a few colors i have access to at the moment and can tell you this color, medium beige chroma 2 1/2 is:
-similar lightness to bare escentuals medium beige, but be is quite a bit yellower base
-lighter by two shades from mac nw25 studio tech formula which is similar to this.  it is the same tone range, however.

this color has a more pink base to it, but is not so pink that it looks strange like some foundations.  this is more suitable for cooler complexions, but not limited to.

how to apply
first of all, make sure that your face is moisturized after cleaning it.  good moisturizing is key.  you can use a primer, if you like.  i happen to really like&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/natasha-denona-face-glow-primer-hydrating-underbase-1-01-oz-30-ml/dp/b01mqjmk21/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8">natasha denona face glow primer hydrating underbase 1.01 oz/ 30 ml</a>&nbsp;for drier skin and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/swanson-hyaluronic-acid-serum-1-fl-oz-29-6-ml-serum/dp/b008ppxba8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8">swanson hyaluronic acid serum 1 fl oz (29.6 ml) serum</a>&nbsp;for more oily or normal and  younger skin.

the way to apply this foundation is to take the jar, open it up and get yourself a beauty blender.  i prefer to stay with the name brand as i have tried many substitutes and still go back to the beauty blender for the best performance.

wet and squeeze out the beauty blender, so it is damp.  then dab the beauty blender into the dermablend and just get a small amount on the surface so that it looks like there is not much at all on there.

choose a quarter of your face area and begin to bounce the sponge all around that area.  it will look like you are not doing much of anything.  trust me, you are.

for under the eyes, take the tip of the beauty blender and from side to side, bounce the foundation from inner to outer corner of the eye.  again, it won't look like you are doing much at first.  keep going.

you won't have to get the surface of the sponge loaded more than four or five times in most cases.  you keep bouncing around and around the skin and suddenly you will see that the skin is covered, but still looks like skin.  that is what you are going for.  any other application method does not do this foundation justice and will not be as realistic/flattering looking.

comments
although i am not as fond of this as i am&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/graftobian-hd-creme-foundation-super-palette-neutral/dp/b004ibu2o6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8">graftobian hd creme foundation - super palette - neutral</a>, which is also available in individual colors, this is as close to it as i have come so far.

my problem with the dermablend is this- it has sunscreen in it.  many times when wearing this level of foundation, there is a special occasion involved.  that usually means photos will be taken.  sunscreen makes for some pretty weird effects on film.  it will look white, or off color in certain light as well.  you can use this at home and think it looks perfect, but in some light it can look really off.

if this did not have sunscreen in it, i would like it better.  however, if you really love sunscreen and don't plan to have photos taken in this foundation or don't care if it looks off in photos or on video, then this is a nice foundation.

wear is pretty much all day, even in humid weather, although it does come off it there is a lot of sweating involved and might need to be reapplied in certain situations.  setting with powder helps a little bit but in really hot sweaty weather, that might not help.

the bottom line
if applied as outlined in this review, this is an excellently performing foundation.  although the color turned out to be lighter than i expected, if applied as i outlined, it will blend well with skin that is not an exact match.  sunscreen in this will alter photos or look off in certain light, but if that does not bother you, then it still is a good choice.  great coverage and generally speaking excellent durability (except extreme humidity and heat) this foundation could be an excellent choice for more natural looking coverage that does not crease excessively or crack off.  if applied any other way, results will be different.

rating
four stars because this has sunscreen in it.  i prefer to have no sunscreen in foundation.  if someone wants to have sunscreen, i prefer to add it separately.  if it did not have sunscreen, i would like it a bit better.",2017-08-24,4,4,AWIF8AR75LL9L,B00014GT8W

217,"my skin is extremely sensitive. it often breaks out in hellishly itchy red dots of hives when i wear sunscreen lotion or very fragrant lotions. my skin did not break out in this foundation, so that's a big plus, especially since this has spf protection.

however, i can only give it 3 stars, because it made me look very unnatural.

it is cakey and dry on my skin. it looks uneven and my skin seems to look peely after sweating just a little bit under the sun. i did not use a set-powder, though, so maybe that's part of the reason. this foundation does not make my skin look smooth - it made all the fine lines even more pronounced. it also feels sticky and easily rubs off.

when i put it on my arm, it was too dark. when i put it on my face, it is too light. maybe if i use a darker color it would look better.

the first photo shows the right side with the foundation and left side without. you can see it's a very faint difference. however, once i put it on my whole face, the middle photo shows how pale my face looked compare to my neck, which is the natural color. i took another photo showing my forehead and how dry it looked after a few hours.

all in all, i don't think i'd be using this often. it looks as good as my mineral based sunscreen lotions.",2017-08-13,3,5,AFDJGY68CQL2X,B00014GT8W
218,"most days i prefer a liquid foundation, they are lighter and easy to mix with my serums to get smooth coverage that stays light and hydrating but full coverage. however as even my liquid was not able to handle when my eczema flares badly i was enthusiastic about trying this dermablend cream. first i like the color range, i have pale skin and can have a really hard time finding shade, many brands don't really go into the fair and lighter shades so it is always a tone off. i did still choose two shades but mostly because it is summer and my skin can get a bit darker. the color i choose for universal use is the rose beige. i was a bit nervous with beige in the title but i followed the chart and went with it. i have to say it is just about perfect. i was also worried with the weight of a formula that was in a heavy pot, and my concern was not necessary. a little goes quite a long way, i did my initial application with my fingers, and then blended and smoothed with a damp beauty blender. the formula on this is really impressive, it can go on thin enough to see my freckles with enough blending, or can be gently blended to cover the worst of my eczema. i was really happy with not only the coverage but the fact that it didn't cause any additional irritation and in fact some of the worst areas even looked a bit more healed after taking it off. the ability to cover what is often large raw areas that embarrass me too much to go out has made this a favorite in my makeup collection. i would give it more than five stars if i could.",2017-08-07,5,5,A2OGN68EIOK1DC,B00014GT8W

225,"foremost, if your skin can handle a primer (and some people with very sensitive skin cannot always do this), try a light amount of primer before applying this this. it will minimize pores and make the product go on smoothly.

now, this is the the proverbial "real deal." it is genuinely full-coverage. therefore, if possible, apply extremely lightly. then use a beauty blender to blend. and, keep blending. then, apply just a little extra with a brush to areas that require more attention (a tattoo, a blemish, a birthmark, etc.). then gently blend that (especially around the edges). use a loose translucent powder to set this. put it on with a dusting of a brush if you have dry to normal skin ... if you skin is oily, gently press it on with a powder puff.

227,"the directions for dermablend cover creme are conflicting and missing a key item for best results.

first, the box has sunscreen directions for liberal all-over application. the paper insert, however, has instructions specific to spot-coverage for imperfections. this wouldn't be a conflict if you could indeed spread this crayon-ish clay-like material all over. but you can't really, unless you mix it with some other smoother product.

this is best used as a spot cover-up, to be followed by a rather long setting period, followed by your favorite all-over make-up. an impressively tiny amount covers quite well. this product will last a long time. the spatula is great for hitting the exact spot and smoothing gently. wipe it clean after each use and put it back in the box you so smartly saved. this little tool will be easy to lose and easy to find via your vacuum cleaner.

what's missing in the instructions? you skin cannot have any flaky areas. this heavy compound accentuates such irregularities, rather than helps to hide or ameliorate them.",2017-07-29,4,5,A18OLZIT0DGVJR,B00014GT8W

(i use urban decay and kat von d setting sprays for all day/night wear). i have rosacea aka red cheeks and when it is hot or i laugh more then usual it will cause my rosacea to become inflamed and be red all day long - i found that the dermablend really helped to keep my red cheeks at bay through out the day.

i did not need heavy coverage and the powder felt pretty weightless. there was no caking throughout the day either - which is a problem i tend to have. i did not have any breakouts or changed with my skin/oil production when using this powder and with minimal effort at the end of the day everything came off easily.",2017-07-29,5,5,A93YMZM7YKG1G,B00014GT8W

"for sunscreen use: apply liberally 15 minutes before sun exposure; reapply at least every two hours; use a water resistant sunscreen if swimming or sweating."

this is obviously in direct contrast to their push that it lasts 16 hours with the powder (which we did not use).

the application is a bit fiddly; the mousse goes right on, but these require a scoop (included, but don't lose it)---it doesn't store with the product well. then you have to warm it in your hands and apply it. it does have a mask-type feel. all of the shades we received seemed darker than expected.

this product covers very well skin blemishes or other imperfections. i have heard from others that some women apply this and then put their regular foundation/concealer over it. there are many ways to use it. i am pleased with how it works and even let a friend try it and she liked the coverage.
this would be a 5 star product if the setting powder came with it, or was at least made known you had to have it.",2017-07-25,4,4,A33SX0AD5PYD9B,B00014GT8W
235,"this shade is a few shades too light for me, but it goes well around the eyes to lighten my dark circles i get from lack of sleep.  the cheeks are a darker tone from the sun, despite using sunblock.

what i like about this brand is the ease in which the cream is applied.  not much is needed. it goes on fast and dries fast, and lasts a half day before fading or sweating off.  it isn't fragranced nor irritating, and it comes with spf 30 sunblock..",2017-07-24,5,5,A11OTLEDSW8ZXD,B00014GT8W
236,"i have quite a brthmark on my face in addition to some scarring from 'days gone by' with acne. this cream really is the only product that lasts any length of time on my face, i seem to absorb products like a sponge and this coverup doesn't sink into my skin and disappear. the color is perfect and looks neutral on my skin. this beige is perfect for warmer days (and tan-ish skin) without being too dark or orange-y. i also love that this coverup has a sunscreen in it too. it does not settle in the wrinkles and lines like other cover creams have from other brands that i have tried. this product is the first i tried from dermablend years ago as a professional makeup artist and paramedical skin care therapist.....and it's still my favorite product for covering all sorts of imperfections from the ordinary situation to the more 'extreme'..... medical procedures.

tips: tap it gently on the skin instead of rubbing on. if it feels "sticky" or thick, simply warm it between 2 fingers before using. can be worn alone (with good color matching) or with foundation. around the eyes, i get a much better result with using a concealer brush to "lay" the color on the skin. use translucent powder on top (i use the white) for setting & longevity.

5 stars, highly recommended!",2017-07-24,5,5,A2GA64WZK8PKBC,B00014GT8W
237,"honestly, i don't care for this as my foundation.  i'm not used to having to add water to my foundation to get it to spread and i don't like having to do that.  however, i am really liking this as a concealer.  i apply it to areas i want to hide (without water).  it's thick enough so that it doesn't come off when i apply my normal liquid foundation on top of it.",2017-07-24,3,5,A1GASYTBITRWV1,B00014GT8W
238,"this was interesting product, unlike most products i have tried.  it has a little spatula that allows you to get the amount desired out of the pot.  you then warm between your fingers and it gets very smooth and soft allowing you to easily blend on spots you would like to cover.  i thought it blended well and that it covered nicely.  i would have liked to see a pot in the lid of the pot that i could keep the spatula.  now i have to try and get track of it.",2017-07-24,5,5,A3TMBYDFP1B9DM,B00014GT8W
239,"the sand beige shade of this dermablend cover cream is listed as a light shade. and if you look at the swatches for the light category, you will see that this is the lightest of the four available. that describes my skin tone exactly: light but with a tendency toward the fair end of the spectrum.

it was to my great dismay then to receive this product and realize that the color was totally off. everything looked promising when the package arrived. the swatch on the outside of the box was a pretty close match to my skin tone. then i opened it and was shocked to see just how much darker the real product was.

i wanted this product to cover a thyroid surgery scar on my neck. all i got was something that will draw even more attention to the imperfection with its fake tan orange glow. ive attached photos so you can see for yourself.

recommendation: go much, much lighter than you think you need to with this dermablend cover cream.",2017-07-22,2,5,A1UH8RMD57P34Y,B00014GT8W

it's wonderful for covering up skin imperfections on your face and hands.

247,"this product does provide a lot of coverage, but it's not a dream product.. you will need more than a thin layer to cover, heavier coverage will need to be built up.  and it's very visible on the skin if you build it up to full coverage, which pretty much defeats the purpose of correcting skin--unless perhaps it's for a stage situation where you will only be viewed at a distance.  i also found this formula on the dry pasty side, and while it may sometimes be the only product that works, it is not a pleasure to work with. and you absolutely will feel having product on, this isn't weightless.  it's not irritating, but it also isn't second-skin-comfortable.

i've worked with this item in several colors and they all are darker than these images appear.  while i do appreciate that they have a wide shade range, i wish better photos and descriptions were provided.

249,"this is supposed to be a cover cream with spf 30 (titanium dioxide sunscreen). as soon as i used it for the first time it really reminded me of vertra elemental resistance sunscreen face stick (tinted), which a lot of surfers prefer to use here. if you have used the vertra stick, most likely this dermablend product will suit you too; and it has more color options, but not for surfing, it washes away in water too easily. this dermablend cover cream is very similar, but little more on the oily side and can cause breakouts easier, also it wipes off way too easy, even slightest contact with my face wiped this "protection" away. this cream seems waaaaay too heavy (oily/layery/film like feel) for me to use as a everyday sunscreen, but not resistant enough for my beach days, so unfortunately i have not found a good use for it. not for my type of skin, anyhow, which is oilier/mixed type and with high humidity around the cream doesn't suite me at all. i believe for someone with super dry skin this can be ok, but it doesn't absorb easily and you feel a layer of it sitting on you and creating breakouts... not for me...",2017-07-17,3,3,APD7XINUVG5AL,B00014GT8W
250,"i was very skeptical about this product when i received it and realized it has the consistently of a thick paste rather than a creamy foundation.  i am a very low fuss person when it comes to cosmetics.  the instructions are easy to read and you basically scoop some of the foundation out with the included tiny plastic spatula, place it on your palm (or index finger), and gently rotate your finger on the product until it is smooth and ready to apply.  you then tap it on your skin and gently smooth it in.  you will need to allow about 2-minutes after application for the product to "set."  my skin looks flawless with this product however use of a setting powder is not an option - it's necessary otherwise my skin gets oily by mid-day.  what was really impressive with this product was how i was able to layer the product over my dark spots from sun damage and they virtually disappeared and the makeup didn't look heavy or caked on my skin.

i'm pleasantly surprised by this product.  it takes some practice to familiarize oneself in applying the foundation; however overall, i found it really easy to use.  the 1 ounce jar will also last a long time as a little bit of this cover creme goes a long way.",2017-07-15,4,5,A1UUI7PFQ5FU4E,B00014GT8W

254,"my tan-complection filipina wife loves dermablend.

she has many different tones on her face and body, so she has several different shades she uses rather than trying to make everything the same color.  it turns out fantastic the way she does it.  i wish i could put a video up of her before, applying and after.  i've never seen any of her make-ups come out so well... plus it has a helpful spf to keep her from getting darker (yes she gets darker with sun exposure).

she's had a zit problem ever since arriving in the usa and has tried many products to stop them.  the only thing that has worked was going back to philippines for 3 months.  we have no idea if it's something in the ingredients of something she eats here, or some sort of spray on the vegetables... but she hides it when she wants to look really nice with an application of dermablend products.

she has 5 different creams, a couple of powders and 2 sticks, varying shades of tan.  she can apply them very quickly now, but of course had to study them carefully for what worked where and such.  i'm pleased that dermablend is available for people like her, though it's a little expensive for the amount you get (my frugal opinion).

she's worth it!

afternote:  i asked her to read over some of the one star reviews from people who were not happy with the results and she could only say maybe they don't clean their face properly and that they should watch some of the zillion youtube tutorials.",2017-07-14,5,5,A2OR94VN7XQCUO,B00014GT8W

263,"i recently was offered durablends cover creme, blurring mousse and leg and body makeup. being already familiar with the products, i was happy to become acquainted with more. my durablend story is personal. we have best friends, another couple, that visit us, or we visit them, at least once a year. we go on combined vacations together every three to five years. wed spent a lot of time together before i learned that my friends face is almost completely covered in hemangiomas. it was a surprise to learn she had to apply makeup to look like shes not wearing makeup. weve sat together many times since, just chatting while she goes through the process of what she calls putting on my face. its interesting to watch and ive asked lots of questions. she applies two liquid foundations and a powder foundation, followed by setting powder. ive watched at least a dozen times and still find it dramatic. its not a process that can be rushed if done right, but when it is, it can last an entire day with just a little touchup. i saw it for myself when new york weather caused our flight home to be cancelled. twenty hours later and way behind schedule, wed collected luggage and were standing at passenger pickup in bright morning sunlight. she whispered and asked me to check if her makeup was still holding up. i was amazed to see no cracking or wear. the foundation was still working. even the darkest portion of her biggest hemangioma remained completely invisible. she gave me my first dermablend, a tube of camo concealer. used with the setting powder, it erases the dark circles under my eyes that i get every allergy season. one application in the morning takes me through the entire day without even a touch up. remembering that, i want to stress the importance of getting the right shade, and that some experimenting is (probably) going to be necessary. i was lucky. she nailed the right shade (light / sesame) for me perfectly the first time (i wouldve picked natural and been wrong). if you're dealing with a large area, its pretty much a given that youll need more than one product in one shade. while you shouldnt expect to get it right the first time, you just might be able to come close. there are many tools on dermablends website, plus online tutorials, there and on other sites, that look to be invaluable for making the leap if a push is needed. dermablend isn't regular makeup. its confidence in a bottle (or tube, jar, etc). i know the way it feels to use it and not think of the dark circles beneath my eyes when the occasional need arises. for others, that use it everyday just to feel comfortable enough to leave the house, it must feel transformative, as much inside as outside.",2017-07-10,5,5,A28I98PKHZZKVB,B00014GT8W

266,"okay, so by now i've tried a whole range of dermablend products - mostly good, some meh. but the cover crme is the best of the bunch and truly what i think of and what i want when i think of dermablend - which is full coverage, anywhere, everywhere. if you can only get one product from their line, this is the one to get. if you want the product that made dermablend its name, this is the product to get. of course, first you have to match your skin tone. keep it mind that your skin has different shades from part to part. the skin on my face is different from the skin on my leg or on my hand. you have to have at least two shades, if not three so you can blend to the perfect match to whatever area you want to cover.

i have medium tones of southeast asian ethnicity. my skin is in the warm class with yellow undertones.

i tried warm beige chroma 2 1/4 but it was just too pink for my face. it did not have the yellow undertone that looks best with my skin. however, i did try the yellow beige chroma 1 1/2 and it was a good match.

with the jar of product comes a little spatula. don't lose it! scrape a little product with the spatula and put it on the back of your hand. don't put too much. i made the mistake of putting too much product out the first time and had to discard half of it when i didn't use it. a little truly goes a long way because this is really thick, hence the full coverage. so, just scrape less than what you think you might need. let the product warm on your hand for a bit and then apply on the skin area in question. i use my index finger. it covers my really dark acne spots and pimples. if it was dark enough for my legs, i would have used it on them for a flawless look. it thoroughly conceals any imperfections. i apply some setting powder, let it set and then brush the excess off and then use a setting spray. it lasts all day.

also, with the amount of product you have, depending on how much area you need to cover, i can easily see this one jar lasting me a very long time, even with every day use.",2017-07-09,5,5,A19RDMX22VXXSD,B00014GT8W

286,"i have loved all the dermablend products i've been trying lately.  i find they offer the same high quality as department store brands but contain much more pigment in them.

this particular cream makeup is for dry skin only.  it has a beautiful luminous finish and the trademark dermablend high concentration of pigments.
but it goes on with noticeable slip.  i used a makeup sponge to apply this.  it looks wonderful but was definitely on the oily side for my skin type.
a bit of powder to set this takes down the slipperiness.  i prefer some of the other products in this line such as the powder foundation.  i have slightly oily skin and large pores and that worked better for me.

if you have dry skin you may like this a lot.  i recommend visiting a store that sells this to make sure you get just the right matching color for your skin.  this is very high quality high end department store makeup for those who want high coverage to hide more obvious imperfections.  it's worth the higher price if you want higher coverage and a truly flawless look.",2017-07-04,4,4,A19UTUEBWKIZFT,B00014GT8W

291,"dermablend cover cr&egrave;me is a full coverage foundation that i wanted to use to cover a birthmark and a healing scar.  the color was "off", so coverage was not completely full coverage as the attached videos show.

color: the honey beige color seems to be more of a reddish brown vs a "honey" brown, so my olive-ish skin wasn't a good match.

coverage: the cr&egrave;me foundation comes with a spatula to scrape the product and allow you to put it onto your hand in order to blend.  i followed the instructions (place on hand, blend/warm, then blot onto coverage area. wait 2 minutes and buff off). coverage was decent and lasted all day. the cr&egrave;me foundation didn't feel "cakey" and didn't settle into "fine" lines.

while i like dermablend's products, i like the cr&egrave;me foundation the least.  application is a little more time-consuming and the color is not as anticipated - which makes it difficult for online ordering). advice-wise, i'd say to try dermablend's liquid camo foundation first to see if the coverage sufficed before reaching for the cr&egrave;me foundation because the camo foundation is quicker to apply and does covers quite well.",2017-07-04,3,4,A2SZLNSI5KOQJT,B00014GT8W

295,"like many people with thyroid/hormonal issues, i have skin discolorations.  i have what i affectionately refer to a lizard spot on my neck.  it's about the size of the palm of my hand.  when the spot becomes inflamed, i use make-up to cover it.  this is why i chose to try dermablend professional cover creme.

pros
1) following the company's instructions, dermablend professional cover creme took only *one* application to completely cover the discoloration on my neck! it took very little make-up to do the job, too.
2) makeup feels light going on and doesn't feel thick or greasy once applied.  (it feels like a good-quality sunscreen, actually.)
3) provides 30 spf.
4) i used it with a transparent mineral powder, and dermablend professional cover creme stayed *fixed* all day.
5) because it's lightweight, it will work well on most skin types.
6) it *does* cover discoloration and some types of scarring. it even masked a keloid scar i have on my cheek and made my skin appear smooth.
7) comes with tiny application spatula.
8) is easily removed with cleansing cream and water.

con
1) dermablend is expensive.

dermablend is excellent quality make-up.  it's designed to cover: and it does just that.  even though i've embraced my lizard spot, it's *wonderful* to apply a tiny bit of cover creme and have it disappear.  many women view make-up as armor against a working world that judges any and every imperfection. i consider dermablend an extension of my confidence. on those days when my discoloration in inflamed, dermablend *is* a moral booster.  i've taken to calling it confidence in a jar.",2017-07-03,5,5,A2B7DW8XZMRMN0,B00014GT8W
296,"the loreal dermablend professional line of cosmetics is new to me.  they earn being in a higher-end category in my opinion. they do not seem to be scented or too chemical. the jars, tubes, compacts are made very sturdy to last along with your make-ups. i have many favorites among them, yet i believe they all stand very well on their own. some two or more of these creamy products come with an application spatula, and this appears to be an optional extra.  also, there is a little instruction leaflet included with every product.

i hope it is going to be efficient way to review all of the ones product in this line, including compatible products along the way. respectively:

i have been using loreal products since the 1980s when my best friend was wearing a frosted lipstick i liked and i later sought out.  it smelled good too. it was a truer color in my eyes, since many comparable brands were putting red tinges into the light pinks and such.  also, some of the loreal colors of lipsticks and eyeshadows were pearly, and i liked them because they looked very ethereal, as with the pink-violet lipstick that changed colors depending on the light.

i have aged, and my last purchase was a loreal infallible product, one of many in a line which rarely or never need reapplication for my creased lids and bitten lips. i have been so obsessed that i have a whole zipper case full of the eyeshadows alone. i have a lot of products from their visible lift line for my skin texture. i especially enjoyed the blur ones.  now i am going to move on to have more choices in my zip bag.

there has been more exposure with loreal in my experience than i can mention here, including most recently, a lovely reddish-brown shade of eyeshadow that stays put, a super-mascara, another lip paint, some face-tone enhancers, and a creamy-to-dry, light-colored eye light, among others.
i am happy to see more high-end products from loreal that should work well for young and old alike, especially since it seemed to me years ago that their products were for my younger crowd.

  1. dermablend cover crme with titanium dioxide sunscreen (30spf):
this is the first item in this line of dermablend cosmetics from loreal that ive received, and it is my very favorite.  it covers my skin imperfections well.

my first attempt with it doesnt count, since i spread it very thin, allowing a bit of dermatitis i had at the time to show some dry skin through.  and i went out that night wondering why this was happening.  i hadnt read the instructions yet.  first of all, i thought i needed to get rid of the rash that was there before reapplying and reviewing this product, and second, i thought i needed to exfoliate since i have dry patches on spots.  now i get it!  this particular crme has to be built up gradually for me. and building it up judiciously is not problematic at all.  this product is soft and smooth.  it appeared to be a very thin product at first, and it kind of softens and blends as you work with it.  it is lovely.

if i use a sponge applicator it will ruin one purpose of it for me which is to cover varying imperfections; and when i apply it with smoothing dabs it appears blended, and i really find out how radiant and thorough a cover cream make-up can be.  it has alone a bit of chroma to it, as does dermablend pro smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation (25 spf),  in my opinion, unlike many other cover products i have used. alone, they gleam in the light more than my other cover make-ups, without chalkiness.  very nice.

the other purpose for me is that it has a (30 spf) sunscreen.  all other cosmetics with sunscreen i have tried have (25 spf) or lower, and not my needed (30 spf) that my dermatologist recommends.  she has said that even in my home with shades closed i am exposing my skin to potential damage.  i score 1,000 % here for this as well as the other qualities of this line.

the two colors i have are both medium ones, one a bit lighter, and both appropriate for me, especially my indulgence of mixing other lighter or darker colored loreal dermablend pro products with them.

ive been feeling a bit like a chemist with the many loreal dermablend pro products listed here. and i realize you may not have this type of a menu, but i am hoping this info will help somehow to see the flexibility here if not anything else.

2. loreal dermablend professional translucent loose setting powder (no spf):
needed. the wonderful crmes i love work nicely with loreal dermablend professional translucent loose setting powder with micronized powder, with the cotton puffs. it hides flaws when that is part of what you are going for.  this particular product is very fine, not grainy, and perhaps a bit creamy.  it definitely blends in well.  it is very nice for creating a thin and matte next barrier, keeping the crme, bases, foundations, from smudging to hands, clothing.  in various ways, since amazon is not going to know my exact skin color, i have experimented, i am able to get some creative looks i sought in using the various loose powder shades together:
 dermablend pro translucent loose setting powder in my three separate medium shades (separate jars); when applied and then dusted off created light on dark or dark on light look as i so chose.

a. what i mean is that with the lighter shade of crme i was able to get the same look with the darker powder, as with the opposite of that technique using the darker crme and a lighter powder. altogether, with these medium shades i was able to get a perfect match, thus prolonging my experience.

b. also, with the white translucent powder i have found that i am getting a more dimensional look by applying the light shade powder on certain areas of my face, and on top or around in certain areas like cheeks, nose, chin, forehead, i will carefully apply and moments later lightly dust the medium-toned translucent powders as described, allowing it to not look quite so much like monotone matte over my sallow complexion.  another plus 1,000%! for me.

i have found recently that i need to put on fine dustings of all powders for myself personally; and not necessarily all over my face and neck.
u have been using a bit of bright cream blush oddly enough, though you may find it unnecessary; you can still have a dimensional look.

i like to play with the powders, yet, when i am in a rush i will make errors, not being subtle, and not dusting before other products.  also, i am 62, and my baggy under-eye application errors are the most noticeable. i get rid of this bagginess first.  i will use the powders now, especially with other lighter dermablend crme applications, or with the high-quality dermablend pro smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation (25 spf) listed below; and as well as their other foundations. all definitely for photos where a shine or two really counts.

one thing that helps give a nice touch over the powders and such is the loreal dermablend professional set + refresh long-lasting make-up setting spray. the powders are probably quite wonderful for an oily skin type, for example; they are nice for a youthful complexion; and i believe they are going to look quite radiant on a woman with less-noticeable pores, and without wrinkle issues along with age and skin texture combined.  in my case i am fine, and safest when i am well-rested.

3. loreal dermablend professional set + refresh long-lasting make-up setting spray (no spf):
these dermablend base products are synergistically enhanced with a nice sheen of fresh with a spray application of loreal dermablend professional set + refresh long-lasting make-up setting spray. just lightly mist your face with your hair pulled back to enhance your look and seal your make-up applications.  the mist isn't as fine as i had expected, but it works for me.  even with dusted powders it will make a difference.  it is that simple for me.

4. loreal dermablend professional smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation (25 spf):
this a product that i had underestimated until today when i applied it under dermablend pro translucent loose setting powder, which may not be necessary if you want that chroma look; yet because i preferred the varying built-up applications i achieved with the dermablend professional crme, i missed something with trying this last.  as before i was too quick to judge.  i had applied it very thick and then i went out.  i thought to myself that is was mask-like, yet nice moist cover.

not only can i spot- apply this creamier-liquidy product to cover the face and problem areas with my fingers, i can also use a sponge blender for a more airbrushed look, then applying more product wherever as needed. i also can add a finishing touch of the dermablend professional set + refresh long-lasting make-up setting spray for a fresh stay; with or without powders. win-win-win.

5. loreal dermablend professional intense powdercamo!! (no spf):
this is a lovely and creamy intense powder in a nice mirrored compact with a sponge applicator, in separate compartments.  while this color is quite dark for me, one quality, besides the products ability to render a fine cover layer if desired, is that i do not see wrinkles really.  maybe the thin layer or the creaminess?  and the staying power, especially with the fresh mist of loreal dermablend professional set + refresh long-lasting make-up setting spray.  also, i can dab and smooth this powder wherever i want to whatever area of the face or neck.  the darker color, applied gently is making a nice bronzer if applied thin.  i do know that is stretching it though. i haven't tried it over the above loreal dermablend professional liquid camo product, since this is a very dark color; however, i suppose this might possibly work; though this does go on thin, and i do not think a crme or foundation is needed to get a good look. very nice camo cover product!

6. loreal dermablend professional quick-fix body (no spf):
wow again.  i hadnt understood at first how i can use this, as one of the colors i own is a darker bronze; and while i hadnt yet noticed the medium (my shade).  i mistakenly applied some of the dark under my cheekbones to see a defined look which actually worked for me, yet thick as i applied it - and silly me! i am thinking that since this product says body in the title it is going to be nice for use on varicose veins and other body imperfections like a permanent rash i have. double win with this product results!

this is a creamy roll-up stick cover product which does the job without rubbing off too much. i love the idea of having a smooth body-skin look as with the generous tube of the wonderful, and long-lasting dermablend professional leg and body make-up; however, im mentioning this quick fix product first as im partial to a more natural, yet youthful, look, only working with the blemishes and letting the natural skins still show through.  this is my personal preference.  it isn't quite going to be looking as flawlessly airbrushed overall as with the full body make-up, yet it is the product i will use first; especially during the day. i love it.

7. loreal dermablend professional leg and body make-up (spf25):
it is so nice to wear tights, stockings, or nylons during the winter to have confidence that leg imperfections will not be seen with dresses, and on ankles under pants above boots.  however, during cooler months especially, it is very nice to see perfect body skin peeking out of your clothing.  not only does this product render a flawless airbrushed look, it is actually very resistant to liquid or rubbing off onto hands or clothing.  i absolutely loved the look when i put it on; and then darn, i was noticing in the light that my shade was a bit peachier than my actual sallow skin.  this might not be problematic for you with full-body applications, as for me on an occasional basis as desired; yet finding your closest match will save you a lot of bother, and will please you i believe.  as i have expressed that this product renders a nice, airbrushed look, and i believe even because of the staying power alone this dermablend pro product is worth looking into.  it just didn't muss up and rub off.

8. loreal dermablend quick-fix concealer stick (spf 30)
this works fabulously; it is creamy and it stays put; it is smart just as the loreal dermablend professional cover crme, because it has that strength of sunscreen that my dermatologist recommends, even as i am in my home, shades drawn, as my dermatologist has warned about.  i have already sun damage under my right eye where there is a dark spot.  this covers very well, looks flawless with or without other products, yet it works synergistically with the wonderful loreal dermablend pro line. i have it in a tan color, and i would have thought since i usually use lighter shades of concealers that it would not have looked so perfect with my medium skin. lovely. plus 1,000%, and very smart.

very nice products indeed.  enjoy!",2017-07-03,5,5,ACJ9N7ED37HXS,B00014GT8W

i could make the same statement about numerous, far less expensive brands.  it last for hours...if you cover it with our equally expensive setting powder.

this full-coverage foundation is smooth, easy to apply and gives complete coverage with just a very, very tiny amount. it comes with a paddle for mixing colors, but use it with a gentle touch, as just a simple swipe of the finger across the surface of the creme produced complete, opaque coverage. it gives a nice satiney finish that is easy to layer with other makeup like blush and highlighter. it has an almost undetectable fragrance, and produces no irritation on my very sensitive skin. it removes well with just soap and water. truly excellent product.",2017-07-02,5,5,A265IEMG2K5R4W,B00014GT8W

306,"this is a maximum coverage cream which can cover scars, acne scars, birthmarks, bruising, burns, hyper-pigmentation, lupus and vitiligo. as such, i found it just a little too heavy for daily wear if you need minimum coverage.

the cream comes with a little paddle which you use to dip a dollop of the make-up onto your hand to warm it. just straight from the jar, no warming, the make-up is rather thick and waxy.

you start with a light coat then add more layers until you get the coverage you need.  a setting powder is a good addition to make the make-up last longer.  dermablend makes a cleaner which works well to remove the make-up.

the make up didn't get cakey or look heavy. it does act as sunscreen which is a nice bonus. however, my face started to feel itchy after a couple of hours and i had to wash it off. i have sensitive skin, so this reaction is not unheard of for me, but i don't think i can use this in any color as my face foundation.",2017-06-28,3,3,A2O421DTA8J0RW,B00014GT8W

unfortunately, the negatives outweigh the positives for me. to begin with, it's not very blendable. i expected it to be creamier than it was--it's actually very dry! i'm pretty pale, but the pale ivory was lighter than my skin tone. i actually have a drugstore foundation/concealer than i like better, and it's about a third of the cost. the dermablend one is tiny! also, "l'oreal usa" is on the bottom of the product, so that's worth noting.

318,"i have tried several dermablend products recently, and this cover creme is definitely my favorite thus far. i think i have finally found my perfect shade for foundation (warm beige). it adds a touch of color without looking artificial, and i don't have to waste time rubbing off excess to tone it down. you can use the included plastic stick to scrape off some foundation (a little can go a long way, but it's a work of trial and error) to place on your hand and activate by rubbing, then applying to your face.

i also used it simply by using my finger to gather up some and then apply it to my face. as with dermablend's other cover cremes, the only negative thing about it is that it's only somewhat waterproof, as indicated by the foundation left behind on my towels after washing my hands, and napkins from dabbing my face when sweaty. at least it doesn't all come off the face without a proper washing or makeup remover, however, so it's not completely bad. all in all, i was impressed by this even if it comes off a little too easily.",2017-06-28,5,4,A39H1GO9E3YQIB,B00014GT8W

dermablend cover creme is not heavy and blends easily.  it is great for covering imperfections.  i finally got the setting powder which made a lot of difference.

it's definitely worth a try.  i waited a long time because i thought it was like a heavy cover up.  it is not.  but, there is a bit of a learning curve, especially if you have been using, like i was, baked foundations or mineral powders.

you absolutely do need to warm it.  it is almost like a thick paste.  i can see using this to cover tattoos or something similar - the coverage is high.  however, as someone who does have a few fine lines, it wasn't ideal, because the waxy texture of the paste means that when it's actually on your face it does settle in to the lines and create makeup creases.  i might try mixing it with a light bb cream to get a more transparent coverage.

it says that it's "never cakey" but after i had applied a thin layer using my hands and my blending brush i definitely noticed it to be more cakey than my normal liquid foundation.  i was expecting a little more from this product as the company has a good reputation.

also, in terms of the color - go to your local sephora or other makeup store before you order it.  i randomly got assigned to the golden beige and it was just slightly too yellow for my undertone.",2017-06-27,4,3,A2VHQDJBZH0Y7P,B00014GT8W

the cafe brown color is about as expected.  the olive brown has more reddish tones and is probably a bit more reddish than expected.

you have to have the color that matches your skin color.  for my girlfriend cafe brown was a good color while oliver brown was a touch dark for her.  this is basically a paste sunscreen that covers your flaws.  the spf 30 will provide good protection from the sun, although it might need to be applied every 2 hours if you're in the water or sweating heavily.

the product looks very natural.  it goes on thick but blends easily.  has a light feel on the skin.  does not feel heavy.  skin feels smooth, no "sandy" feeling.  can hide some flaws or imperfections and gives your skin a smooth and even appearance.  we recommend that you blend it in your palms before applying to your skin.

as mentioned, i'm very white, but using this product makes it look as if i have deep natural tan.  so it's not just for people with darker skin, but people with really white skin could use it too.  might be better than some tanner as it's not greasy and doesn't run off.  the product is completely unscented.  it's a small quantity of product, but a little goes a long way.

as a concealer the dermablend product works very well, and though it has a rather odd fragrance, it disappears pretty soon after the product is applied, so fragrance may not be a problem for those who are sensitive. the color was a bit darker than i expected but it blends fine with my skin tone anyway. the product comes in a small, easily transported container, and the one i received looked fresh and appealing.

345,"if you need a full coverage foundation and you do not have very many facial wrinkles, then this cover creme by dermablend may work well for you. it is definitely a thick makeup which will help to cover any pigmentation problems. however, because it is a very thick cream (almost as heavy as the average concealer), if you have the normal lines and wrinkles on your face that are a result of aging, then this foundation may catch in those lines and not give you a smooth finish. one of the important things is to blot your skin after the makeup is applied. the directions also call for a "setting" powder, however, that may also just increase the "caking" effect in the lines of your skin. personally, i did achieve a good, matte finish with this makeup and did not feel the need for a setting powder. one thing to note, this color was a bit darker and a bit more orange than i expected. if you normally have fair skin, this color may work for you if you have a facial tan.",2017-06-22,4,4,A29VG90T649CSU,B00014GT8W

this foundation has nice coverage. similar to a color-stay liquid foundation, but looks more natural. i've applied with with a makeup sponge and also with my fingers and i find it definitely blends better with a sponge. the natural beige is a touch more tan in person compared to the online photo, but the foundation blends easily enough that even if you're off a little in the shade, you can make it look natural.

i've been using this foundation without the setting powder and so far it's working well for me. i've just been applying a pressed powder to the top of it to set it. however i might order the setting powder that's designed to be used with this foundation to see how they work together.

this product has been around for a long time.  keeping a firm 100 percent good reputation for quality ingredients. unlike many brands that often change ingredients.

go's on smoothly blends easily and when left for a setting period of time, gives a beautiful coverage.  it is not thick.  i wanted to cover up some very very dark bruises on my arms. bruises caused due to thin skin, that often form  from age and medicine.
coverage that on close inspection stand up.

another great pro is the ability to cover and the length of time it keeps covering.  having coverage for 24 hours is what i am experiencing.

being waterproof until soap is applied. another outstanding feature.

the bruise formulas may fade blood bruising but for trips and activities outside of home .... this completely gives a coverage so you are not self conscious of deep dark bruises.

374,"this is a review of dermablend full coverage foundation makeup in shade natural beige. this foundation is quite creamy and just a little was needed for moderate to full coverage. this foundation is buildable, however, i noticed that on my nose and cheek bone areas, it appeared very splotchy and cakey and i could not correct this (the description claims it is not). i love that the spf is so high (30) to help to reduce sun damage. i took one star off because it claims to be "smudge proof" and "transfer resistant", yet a gentle blow of my nose in a tissue, or a light touch on my face takes this product off (even when using a primer and when set with powder). i added 1 collage picture, untouched, with 2 pictured taken in the same lighting. the first picture is after moisturizing my clean face (zero makeup) and the second picture is after applying the dermablend foundation (i used a foindation brush). i have to say that for the coverage this foundation offers, it is very light and breathable on your skin. without too much touching of my face, it did last most of the day. i noticed it wore off of my nose and chin more than anywhere else. i am not sure if this product conceals scars, brusises, birthmarks, burns, etc. as it claims since i don't have those to cover. it did even out my skin tone, reduce redness, and cover up some of my blemishes. overall pleased with the product but not sure how well it will work for those with more significant skin issues.",2017-06-17,4,4,A2ZXBFBA7EKYNR,B00014GT8W
375,"this full coverage foundation works remarkably well on light, dry skin.  we initially spread the foundation directly on skin, and then worked the foundation across the skin manually to even the coverage and to avoid a caked appearance.  note that a good-quality makeup brush would work as well.  to make the test as fair as possible, we applied on one side, and left the other side clean.  once the foundation is worked into the skin it almost seems to disappear, but a mirror comparison showed that the difference with and without the foundation was dramatic.  many minor blemishes were covered, and skin tone was much more uniform.  darker blemishes showed through, but were reduced in color.

the skin on which we applied the foundation was naturally dry, meaning little oil.  we were pleased that the foundation contained sufficient mineral oil, wax, and other substances that the foundation moisturized the skin a little in addition to providing more uniform color and blemish reduction.  obviously this foundation is not a moisturizer, but it is great that the foundation provides at least some moisture.

this foundation also has some sun block capability with spf 30.  similar to the moisturizing effects, the ability to block the sun is a plus.  while the sun block capability is far less than the capability of a true sun screen, for short term exposure to the sun spf 30 should be sufficient.

we observe that the price of this foundation is higher than average.  on the other hand, this foundation seems to blend well without caking, and is more than just a foundation.  as with many things, the best way to see the difference between a budget foundation and this foundation is to try both at the same time, one type on each side of the face.  we believe the difference will be obvious and will help determine which kind is best for your skin.

many kinds of foundation only provide one capability.  in addition to subduing skin color variations and providing a more uniform skin color, this foundation also provides some skin moisture and provides modest sun block capabilities.  we always like multifunction products that perform their primary function well

i ordered this because it is called deep brown. i'd like to think i have deep brown skin, but not real dark skin. i ordered this cover creme and found it to be several shades than my regular skin. however, what i ended up doing was mixing it with a light contouring shade of make up and using it in the contour areas of my face. i'v recently ordered two other colors with the hope that when they arrive, at least one will match my skin color.

the instructions a to apply liberally every two hours. i don't like this because i'd rather have something that has at least 6-8 hours of coverage. i live a busy life and don't have time to stop every two hours to reapply this, which means i'd have to reapply other products. the good thing is that it is a sunscreen with spf 30. i do like having to use only one product instead of two.

you definitely want to go to the dermablend site to do color match & see what product works for you.

i chose a yellow base bc yellow is a natural neutralize.
the pod will look darker than the site & box but it warms into the skin with a brush & will color match.

i applied this to my face with a foundation brush then pressed it with the butt of a foundation sponge.
i did prep with bronx colors q10 primer & finish with dermablend setting spray.

it covered my dark circles without settling into wrinkles
it covered my sun spots without hiding my face.
it covered my the redness on my nose without "caking" it out in my pores.

i remember a boss telling me years ago to get dermablend to cover a leg tattoo.
not a "concealer", dermablend bc it stays.

here's what worked best for me. i took the spatula and put a fairly thick coat on my sun spots and spread the outsides with the spatula, i then used my normal foundation, then i reapplied the cream again with the spatula and used powder to finish.

it did an okay job of covering it up but not as great as everyone that gave it 5 stars made it out to be. it's very hard to work with, very time consuming. if you use too much it cooks cakes, if you don't use enough it's as good as a useless concelear stick.

385,"i found this sunscreen cover creme to be a little too thick for my taste. i couldn't get the knack of applying it perfectly.
you need very little for coverage. also, it is recommended that you reapply it every few hours when out in the sun.

it may be that i should have chosen a somewhat darker shade to match my skin color, which is not as pale in the summertime. summer is, of course, the ideal time of year to use this product, as it is thick and, as mentioned, contains sunscreen.

if you have blemishes, redness, or splotchiness, this creme may be ideal for your face. the coverage is even and complete.
just be sure to go with the exact shade you want for your face.

i have found that the creme is nice to have for less noticeable areas of my body after a mild sunburn. the creme helps protect the area from further sun damage.",2017-06-16,3,5,A1QS1B2IW9SWHC,B00014GT8W

face, arms or legs (they offer another type of demablend for arms and legs, actually), it is very reliable and never runs or cakes. the only important thing you need to know is that there is a setting powder dermablend offers which keeps this foundation in place and is the final touch to this excellent makeup! great stuff!",2017-06-13,5,5,A2K4HN6EECBNR3,B00014GT8W

i like it has spf 25 in it.  that is one less thing i have to apply under my make-up since i have had two moles removed and my surgeon told me to wear spf everyday, rain or shine.

396,"this full coverage sunscreen has many fine qualities. the color is very nice, though with maybe a hint too much orange for me. it blends beautifully and covers very well. i have a mole on my face that it mostly covered, but it did very well relative to other coverups i've tried.

i used it on my face, one hand and wrist. i was not only impressed by the color and coverage, but by how water resistant it was. i wore it on my face and had to wash it off with a little soap or makeup remover after about six hours. (i tried both. they both worked.) on my hand it lasted just a few hours, but i washed my hands several times and was impressed by how long it did.

there is no smell. it blends well but you can use a drop of water to help it too. it does not make your skin greasy, oily or dry. it has a very natural look and feel.

397,"i am sure after using this product, that it is exactly what it touts to be.  that is a durable, full coverage foundation makeup.  be sure that that is exactly what you want because that is what you are going to get.
i am a fair complected senior citizen with very fair skin.  still a few freckles.  what i don't need is a product like this one.  i think that this product is relatively easy to apply.  i followed the directions exactly.  there is a little spatula included and i used it to take a small amount of product (it only takes a little, believe me) and put it on the back of my hand.  then i used my fingers to "stir" the product a little and then apply it to my face.  wow!  a little bit of this stuff goes a long way.  just remember that you can always add more but it is more difficult to take some away.
several things of note here.
1) much, much darker than i needed
2) coverage is total.  i mean total.  you get a flawless look.  rather like stage makeup with which i am familiar.
if that is what you want, fine.  personally i prefer a more natural look.  if you too are looking for natural then this is not what you want.
summary---i would prefer to use a concealer or cover up just on the spots where i might need it and not go for a total coverage foundation.  that is what this is and that is what you will be getting when you order this.",2017-06-12,1,5,A32XGYDA14KT13,B00014GT8W

401,"there has apparently been repackaging since the last time i purchased this product, as the container is now clear instead of white.  i think the formula may also be slightly different because i found the application much easier than with my first jar. (not as "solid", softened much easier)  i purchased this because i needed something a teeny bit darker than what i had.  just like i said in my quick fix review, my skin looks much lighter to the observer than it really is (red hair, freckles), and if i use fair, ivory, light, etc, i look like a ghost so i moved down to a real "medium" in beige.  i like dermablend for a number of reasons:  it was originally formulated for scar coverage, so the coverage you get is going to be better than just about any other foundation; despite this, it doesn't look caked on if applied correctly; and there are lots of shades to choose from.  because it covers scars very well, it also works just as well for uneven skin colors, blemishes, freckles, and just about any other "imperfection" you may have, again without looking cakey.  the foundation is also waterproof so it stays put, and it blends in very nicely so that you can feather the coverage out (no lines at the chin and jaw).  i probably would not recommend this for someone with oily skin, because of the fact that it is waterproof (which means it's probably not water based) but i would check with the manufacturer to be sure.  it works perfectly for my "mature" skin which is very dry.",2016-02-18,5,5,A2KXWUEUE51LGL,B00014GT8W

473,"ok- i'm gonna "tell it like it is"

i think jack black is a good line, but not a great line, and is overpriced in general.

my personal skin care regimen:
1. billy jealousy shave cream- cheaper than jack black and in my opinion better
2. billy jealousy shaved ice after shave healer- the jack black is pretty good too, but i like the billy jealousy better.
3. jack black facial moisturizer- i do like this product a lot
4. i used the protein booster skin serum- saw no real difference, and for as much as it costs, you could find better options.
5. i do like the jack black eye serum.

in general, jack black is considered more of an "anti-aging" line, hence the higher price point.

i am not saying their products are bad in any way, i just think there are better products out there for the money.
one line i'm going to look into is the "menscience" line of products.

but, you really can't beat the billy jealousy shave cream. i have super sensitive skin, and never see any red inflamed skin when using this shave cream.",2014-12-01,4,3,A33J53S6YK1UA5,B00021CDQ6

- one bottle lasted me through the winter

cons:
- i can't really tell if this is doing anything - if i use this instead of my usual toner before moisturizing, does it add any benefit that i wouldn't already get with my toner?

this is a really confusing product to review. i like it, and it feels nice, but i can't determine if using it has any lasting effect on my skin or if it is really more of a refreshing spritzer for a hot day. this is why i can't recommend using it in place of your usual toner (however, i have to assume using this is better than using no toner at all as it still helps moisturizer soak in faster).

i can definitely see using this on an airplane, however, where the stale air is drying and you're likely to be tired. also, an office setting would be appropriate as well.",2017-04-21,4,3,A2M6J4CGEA29JI,B0002CEIQ8

-spray on mist, then immediately follow with moisturizing cream;
-this combo will work double-time b/c the veil of water acts as an extra reservoir for the cream to pull from and then bind it into the skin.
-much faster hydration than applying cream straight to dry skin.

if you're misting without locking in the moisture, then you're just drying out your face. ever spray a paper towel with water and let it dry? it gets stiffer and stiffer, drier and drier b/c of the law of osmosis. this is mirrored especially in dry weather, where the action of humectants is reversed and they will actually suck moisture out away from skin. that's why it's so important to lock in the water with something occlusive.

i have used avene, evian and laroche posay's thermal waters. they all work about the same, but evian's mineral content does not seem compatible with my skin. i find this one on par with avene, both reasonably priced.",2017-02-23,5,5,AZ26CDSJ363AH,B0002CEIQ8
494,"after purchasing a similar product in three small bottles from evian, i was excited to get a test this huge bottle. while initially i was a little shocked at how big the bottle is, i find that i really like the size. i just leave it out on my dresser and every time i pass by, i give my face a spritz to keep it moisturized and glowing. it really does help my skin stay happy.

i've also enjoyed using it before my toner in the morning, and before applying lip stains, which sometimes sink into the cracks in my lips unevenly. the light dusting of water seems to spread out the tint to where it applies really nicely on my lips.

the main difference between this and evian's three pack of travel bottles is that this one seems to impart a much finer mist of water which soaks in easily and is less obvious if i immediately go outside or to hang out with other people. more dewy, and less like you just spritzed yourself in the face with water.

while you may feel a little silly spending a chunk of change on spray bottle of water, the fine mist that comes out of this definitely makes it worthwhile. i don't know about any claims of minerals or anything like that, but the product definitely performed as claimed with regards to adding a fine amount of moisture to your face either to water down heavier products or just to top up your skin with a drink throughout the day.

i've been using the korean 10 step skincare routine as outlined by charlotte cho in her book of skincare, and after oil and foam cleansing, have been favoring this, then klair's toner, klair's vitamin c toner, cosrx snail essence, eye cream, then face cream and sunscreen on top. this definitely added results when used 2-3 times a day or more. my skin is glowing in comparison to what it was like 6 months ago.",2017-02-11,5,5,A2MBLVMVDLHK1L,B0002CEIQ8

i use this mist to wake me up in the morning, as a pick me up throughout the day, and as a toner in the evening. it is perfect to use before applying moisturizer because it preps the skin to seal moisture in. the spray nozzle imparts a fine, even mist. some facial mists are more like sprinklers--but this one is not ;) when spraying it on over my makeup, it does give me a nice glow, but does not particularly extend the wear of my makeup like a fixative mist would. it definitely doesn't ruin my makeup, though! i use it often when i wear mineral powder foundation, because it helps takes away the powdery look. although it's "just water", i truly believe this lrp thermal spring water has a soothing effect. if my skin feels inflamed or sensitive, this calms it. it is rich in skin soothing minerals, as well as selenium, which is an antioxidant.

the thermal spring water comes out in a very fine mist so it can be used not just before applying moisturizer to help lock it in, but any time throughout the day as a way to wake-up the skin and shed a bit of that grimy feeling that seems to accumulate in the course of the day. a way to feel human again.

the other way to use this product is as a mid-day (or night time) pick me upper. you know that feeling you get when you splash some water on your face to freshen up or shake the cobwebs off? this spray provides a similar sensation amped up two or three notches higher. the spray is gentle enough that there's no irritation on your eyes (although i do initially spray with my eyes closed) and i let the fine mist simply air dry off my skin which provides a healthy, natural and rejuvenated finish a few minutes later. the tender and delicate results makes this one worth trying out particularly if you've been using harsher toners up until now.",2015-12-09,4,5,A3M6TSEV71537G,B0002CEIQ8

now, i did show this to my dermatologist and she confirmed that while it cannot do anything to improve skin quality (look to peptides and retinol for scientifically proven improvement), it is not harmful (in any manner) and will not interfere with the efficacy of other products.

i happen to like it but no more or less than evian's brumisateur.  neither of these products do much, in my opinion, to moisturize, firm or tone your skin.  they are, however, refreshing on a hot summer day and they're not half bad for setting makeup.  i also like to use this when traveling by air to refresh my face when i'm feeling a bit oily.  i just mist heavily, then wipe down with a cotton round and apply a light moisturizer.",2015-11-12,5,4,A25CGBLRJB6X0S,B0002CEIQ8

my husband recently came home after working outside in the wind all day and had very dry, scaly skin.  i decided to try spraying the thermal spray on his dry skin and then putting lotion on over that.  we used burt's bees shea butter lotion over the thermal spray.  by the evening, very surprisingly his skin was looking a lot less scaly, felt fairly soft, and wasn't cracking.  i didn't use a control....one arm without thermal spray, one arm with thermal spray.  but i was rather surprised.  i can't say how long this will last, i don't get spray happy, but there does some to be quite a bit of product.  again this seems very strange to do, i can't speak to all the claims the company makes, but instead of using toner, i spritz my face, put on my moisturizer and it seems to really make my moisturizer more effective, i don't have a good explanation for this, but that does seem to be the case.",2015-10-30,4,3,A89ZZKNDFQH23,B0002CEIQ8

it couldn't be easier to use, just spray the face - it is very gentle, and wait a few minutes and you can pat it dry.
it reminds me a bit of rose water spray, which i usually use because i like the rose scent, and it just works well for me, but this is unscented, works well, is natural, and it seems like a better formulation for calming skin and using after office (or sometimes, at-home) procedures like chemical peels.

yes, it does seem strange to buy an aerosol can of water, but this is ph balanced at 7.0, and has no sd alcohol, witch hazel, fragrance, or other irritating ingredients.

but how is it different from tap water, assuming yours is also at ph 7 level?  it's in the delivery.  this dispenses (for a while) a very fine mist of water continuously.  it dispenses extremely fine water droplets very gently.  i've tried using plastic bottles, but can never get them to dispense so effectively.  it's very nice to use just before applying moisturizer.  i can (well, could) get a very fine layer of water on my skin, which makes it easier to apply moisturizer, and use less as well, offsetting the cost of this product.

i was in love until i got halfway through the can.  i always keep it capped, but the nozzle is clogged.  i've wiped it dry, tried shaking the can, wiped it dry again, but it keeps clogging.  this make it dispense unevenly.  sometimes just a little water comes out, then it spurts.  this i find very disappointing, because it's difficult to find any product resembling a toner that doesn't have noxious ingredients.",2013-09-14,3,1,A3IOCPLIMYDBCD,B0002CEIQ8

as for face... this or any one other product won't replace an aesthetician because a great aesthetician will vary her treatments. mine deals with a variety of peels at different strengths, natural products, and once in a while we do microdermabrasion. plus massaging for oxygen flow and firmness, and so on. i learn so much from her. she can see what's hormone versus diet, stress, rosacea, what to watch out for. i went from acne to clear over time with her.

also it's just good to vary products. weather changes, humidity, age, stress, diet and other factors keep us in our toes so i would say this product is good among others, based on what i need at that time.

not criticizing the product, i did give it 5 stars, just not a save-all. i'd say incorporate it into the routine but vary your treatments and keep an open mind. this one is a little strong for daily. i'd say it's a good 1-2x week routine for the face.

neutralize after use. (i don't only on my back)

don't forget whatever you do to use sunscreen always. or this is all for nothing. ;)",2016-04-01,5,5,AVTFO4SHPBMFI,B0002MPS7G

596,"so, as i was searching the internet one night for a product to help my adult cystic acne, i came across these glycolic acid treatment pads. the reviews were great, and they were also supposed to help with fine lines and wrinkles! i was very skeptical for sure, but i was also desperate, so i ordered them.

after one week of using this product, i noticed my pores were definitely not as noticeable and my acne was greatly improving! i was still thinking there's no way this product is this great! i also noticed that my skin looked brighter and healthier as well.

so, i was nearing the end of the jar, and i began to notice that my forehead lines were softening and my laugh lines were also not as noticeable as before. i was officially sold on this product! not only had it basically cleared up my skin (aside from a hormonal related pimple here and there near my cycle), but my skin also appeared so much more youthful!

i am so excited about this product and hope that everyone suffering from adult acne will give it a shot! i know everyone's skin is different, and what worked for me may not work for everyone. however, this product will help exfoliate and cleanse the dirt and grime away from your skin no matter what. so, it definitely won't hurt to try, and it's a great value as well. i am definitely singing the praises of my new found go-to product for acne and wrinkles!

this product may cause stinging when you first begin to use it, especially if you have never used glycolic acid products before. it wasn't that bad for me, and would only sting for a few seconds, so i didn't have any issues continuing to use the 20% strength. however, if you do have really sensitive skin, i suggest that you start with the 10 or 15% strength glycolic acid pads. glycolix makes those strengths as well. good luck!

bottom line: try these if you're looking for something to help rid you of stubborn adult acne, or if you're simply looking for something to help with anti-aging or to help with wrinkles that have already formed. this product really is great!",2015-06-12,5,5,A3R79D9SZA0QDU,B0002MPS7G

601,"i've been using a prescription-strength retin-a cream for about eight years, and generally have pretty good skin.  at the age of 42, though, i've been plagued by acne outbreaks that have been leaving deep red marks on my face that don't easily fade.  after doing some research, i had heard that glycolic acid peels can help fade acne scars, so i ordered this one based on the positive reviews -- and it really is fantastic!

i waited to use this for two weeks before writing a review, but even in that short amount of time, it has already made a huge difference in my skin, which appears brighter and feels smoother.  i've also noticed a pretty dramatic difference in my fine lines and wrinkles, especially around the eye area.  my red acne marks are also slowly fading, and i'm not getting as many breakouts as i had been.

i've been alternating this with my retin-a cream at night, and use one pad on my face, neck, chest, and the back of my hands.

my sensitive skin tingles a bit after using this, but it's not too bad and the tingling goes away after a few minutes.

the other products that may also be helping are the vitamin c serum and antioxidant serum from paula's choice that i've also been using.  i've been using the paula's choice products for about three months, though, and it was really adding in this glycolix product that kicked things up a bit.

the powder was a little lackluster on my skin. the powder is super very fine and includes a pufff which fluffed up very nicely. i tried applying the powder with the puff but felt like it was immediately absorbing into my skin and i couldn't really tell where the powder had been applied, so i ended up using even more. i preferred using a powder brush to apply this so i could tap off the excess powder before applying and so i could better control where it was being applied. i didn't love this powder as much as i hoped. rather than having a silky feeling going on to my skin, it was more like matte and oil absorbing. it made my usually dewy skin feel very dry and matte and although i used the powder sparingly, it didn't blend into my make up and i felt like i had a light dusting of white on my skin. it looked a little ghostly, flat and dry. i know most powders by design are somewhat oil-absorbing but i felt like immediately absorbed into my make up as soon as i applied it more than any other traditional powder i've used.

this is the first time i have used a make-up setting spray and i didn't notice a dramatic difference using this product. it felt nice going on and did have a wide spray to cover my entire face. i was pleased that it didn't seem to smear any of my applied make up and it did seem to dry everything in place. it did leave my skin a litte flat and dry looking. unfortunately i have very acne-prone skin and i felt like this spray flared up my acne.",2017-12-29,2,3,ADFLBRY00Y70G,B0002RI2PG

then came dermablend.  i do not know why this product is so different from the others but it is and it works!  not only does my makeup not look thick and cracked after using it, but it stays on longer, enduring throughout an entire day.  yes, even when i get a bit sweaty.  wow!  so this gets an a+ from me and will probably end up being a part of my daily makeup routine.",2017-12-29,5,4,APPCJX62WKIIP,B0002RI2PG

(if given the choice, she would have ordered a colored powder and given the product a higher rating because it would have been a good dupe for laura mercier powder.) you can reduce this by adding more foundation powder but this just causes you to set your makeup twice. my daughter says the setting spray is just okay. the mist isn't fine enough and leaves big droplets on your face. it also smells a little strange. overall, she says the products work but aren't good enough to justify the price.",2017-12-23,3,3,A1RX2N300NHQAF,B0002RI2PG

the secret handshake to make this product work perfectly (and it can work perfectly) is to use a light hand  and then back off to an even lighter hand.  it may take a few tries but with practice youll get very nice results.

i tried again without the foundation to see if (since it had color) it would just sit on top of the moisturizer and primer as a foundation - and i was back to orange.

the good news - it didn't irritate my skin, and as a setting powder it did work really well - if it hadn't had the color involved.  the color issue will keep me from purchasing this again - although i imagine that the colorless powder would work really well - i haven't tried it.  my suggestion would be to try this in the color free version if you are looking for a setting powder.",2017-08-15,3,5,A3P8ZDHC7XSKSE,B0002RI2PG

637,"i should begin by saying that my review likely would have been different if i had got the translucent color instead of cool beige. i loved the product itself, but really disliked the color of cool beige.

application: this setting powder comes in a standard 1oz plastic jar. the lid screws off and there are holes to allow you to sift the powder out a bit at a time. it came with a fuzzy applicator puff but i felt like that was wasting a lot of product so i switched to my usual brush. the directions say to apply liberally and buff off after letting it set for 2 minutes. unfortunately, the cool beige tint of the powder really darkened my foundation (currently using dermablend mousse foundation) in uneven patches so i was unable to use as directed. when applying just a tiny amount with my brush and quickly blending i could minimize the darkening and prevent the splotching effect. i was really surprised that it darkened my foundation as much as it did and in such an uneven way. i have used tinted setting powder before and my skin is not at all pale. for reference, i wear an nc35 in mac.

wear: after i got over the quirk of it darkening my foundation, i was pleased with how it extended the wear of my foundation. it gave a nice matte look without looking or feeling dry. my skin stayed fairly oil and smudge free for over 16 hours. i expect the results may have been even more favorable if i was able to apply generously as directed. once i get through the cool beige, i will repurchase in the translucent color and update my review.",2017-07-21,3,4,A1E3TWWRB1Q7CS,B0002RI2PG

641,"this is a nice, soft finish, finely milled powder that performs well and is somewhat forgiving in terms of shade.  it's non irritating to my sensitive skin and offers a good setting powder option for use with dermablend cream products.  i have no issue with this product, but i don't see where or how it stands out from other powders; i frankly like my almay powder just as much, even though it's far less expensive (and attempts far less specificity in it's color choices).  however, where this one stands out is in it's darker color range, as there is certainly offers more options than many other lines.  still, i find there's enough transparency to these powders (i've worked with several shades on several different people) to allow several workable shade options for most people.  this is not an exact skin match hypercoverage powder.  as for all the colors i have tried, all the amazon product images look lighter than the actual products, so when in doubt go for a lighter color.  many of the darker shades lean a bit orange and the fairest tend cooler.

it's a good powder and i will continue to use it.  but i won't repurchase because it didn't distinguish itself enough from other products, and though the shade range seems large, there's not an exact match.  and although i don't demand much coverage from a setting powder, it should be noted that the coverage level was a bit less than anticipated given the reputation of this brand.",2017-07-17,4,3,A2CZ98V784SRJ0,B0002RI2PG

as far as setting powder, it works, it just doesn't help with shine at all and honestly i saw no difference between this and using my more "compact" type foundation as a setting powder instead.  i would suggest using something along those lines with a kabuki brush, it's easier to control the amount and still does the same thing.",2017-07-11,3,3,AUV3OR951650C,B0002RI2PG

i have been using loreal products since the 1980s when my best friend was wearing a frosted lipstick i liked and i later sought out.  it smelled good too. it was a truer color in my eyes, since many comparable brands were putting red tinges into the light pinks and such.  also, some of the loreal colors of lipsticks and eyeshadows were pearly, and i liked them because they looked very ethereal, as with the pink-violet lipstick that changed colors depending on the light.

i have aged, and my last purchase was a loreal infallible product, one of many in a line which rarely or never need reapplication for my creased lids and bitten lips. i have been so obsessed that i have a whole zipper case full of the eyeshadows alone. i have a lot of products from their visible lift line for my skin texture. i especially enjoyed the blur ones.  now i am going to move on to have more choices in my zip bag.

there has been more exposure with loreal in my experience than i can mention here, including most recently, a lovely reddish-brown shade of eyeshadow that stays put, a super-mascara, another lip paint, some face-tone enhancers, and a creamy-to-dry, light-colored eye light, among others.
i am happy to see more high-end products from loreal that should work well for young and old alike, especially since it seemed to me years ago that their products were for my younger crowd.

  1. dermablend cover cr&egrave;me with titanium dioxide sunscreen (30spf):
this is the first item in this line of dermablend cosmetics from loreal that ive received, and it is my very favorite.  it covers my skin imperfections well.

my first attempt with it doesnt count, since i spread it very thin, allowing a bit of dermatitis i had at the time to show some dry skin through.  and i went out that night wondering why this was happening.  i hadnt read the instructions yet.  first of all, i thought i needed to get rid of the rash that was there before reapplying and reviewing this product, and second, i thought i needed to exfoliate since i have dry patches on spots.  now i get it!  this particular cr&egrave;me has to be built up gradually for me. and building it up judiciously is not problematic at all.  this product is soft and smooth.  it appeared to be a very thin product at first, and it kind of softens and blends as you work with it.  it is lovely.

if i use a sponge applicator it will ruin one purpose of it for me which is to cover varying imperfections; and when i apply it with smoothing dabs it appears blended, and i really find out how radiant and thorough a cover cream make-up can be.  it has alone a bit of chroma to it, as does dermablend pro smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation (25 spf),  in my opinion, unlike many other cover products i have used. alone, they gleam in the light more than my other cover make-ups, without chalkiness.  very nice.

the other purpose for me is that it has a (30 spf) sunscreen.  all other cosmetics with sunscreen i have tried have (25 spf) or lower, and not my needed (30 spf) that my dermatologist recommends.  she has said that even in my home with shades closed i am exposing my skin to potential damage.  i score 1,000 % here for this as well as the other qualities of this line.

the two colors i have are both medium ones, one a bit lighter, and both appropriate for me, especially my indulgence of mixing other lighter or darker colored loreal dermablend pro products with them.

ive been feeling a bit like a chemist with the many loreal dermablend pro products listed here. and i realize you may not have this type of a menu, but i am hoping this info will help somehow to see the flexibility here if not anything else.

2. loreal dermablend professional translucent loose setting powder (no spf):
needed. the wonderful cr&egrave;mes i love work nicely with loreal dermablend professional translucent loose setting powder with micronized powder, with the cotton puffs. it hides flaws when that is part of what you are going for.  this particular product is very fine, not grainy, and perhaps a bit creamy.  it definitely blends in well.  it is very nice for creating a thin and matte next barrier, keeping the cr&egrave;me, bases, foundations, from smudging to hands, clothing.  in various ways, since amazon is not going to know my exact skin color, i have experimented, i am able to get some creative looks i sought in using the various loose powder shades together:
 dermablend pro translucent loose setting powder in my three separate medium shades (separate jars); when applied and then dusted off created light on dark or dark on light look as i so chose.

a. what i mean is that with the lighter shade of cr&egrave;me i was able to get the same look with the darker powder, as with the opposite of that technique using the darker cr&egrave;me and a lighter powder. altogether, with these medium shades i was able to get a perfect match, thus prolonging my experience.

b. also, with the white translucent powder i have found that i am getting a more dimensional look by applying the light shade powder on certain areas of my face, and on top or around in certain areas like cheeks, nose, chin, forehead, i will carefully apply and moments later lightly dust the medium-toned translucent powders as described, allowing it to not look quite so much like monotone matte over my sallow complexion.  another plus 1,000%! for me.

i have found recently that i need to put on fine dustings of all powders for myself personally; and not necessarily all over my face and neck.
u have been using a bit of bright cream blush oddly enough, though you may find it unnecessary; you can still have a dimensional look.

i like to play with the powders, yet, when i am in a rush i will make errors, not being subtle, and not dusting before other products.  also, i am 62, and my baggy under-eye application errors are the most noticeable. i get rid of this bagginess first.  i will use the powders now, especially with other lighter dermablend cr&egrave;me applications, or with the high-quality dermablend pro smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation (25 spf) listed below; and as well as their other foundations. all definitely for photos where a shine or two really counts.

one thing that helps give a nice touch over the powders and such is the loreal dermablend professional set + refresh long-lasting make-up setting spray. the powders are probably quite wonderful for an oily skin type, for example; they are nice for a youthful complexion; and i believe they are going to look quite radiant on a woman with less-noticeable pores, and without wrinkle issues along with age and skin texture combined.  in my case i am fine, and safest when i am well-rested.

3. loreal dermablend professional set + refresh long-lasting make-up setting spray (no spf):
these dermablend base products are synergistically enhanced with a nice sheen of fresh with a spray application of loreal dermablend professional set + refresh long-lasting make-up setting spray. just lightly mist your face with your hair pulled back to enhance your look and seal your make-up applications.  the mist isn't as fine as i had expected, but it works for me.  even with dusted powders it will make a difference.  it is that simple for me.

4. loreal dermablend professional smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation (25 spf):
this a product that i had underestimated until today when i applied it under dermablend pro translucent loose setting powder, which may not be necessary if you want that chroma look; yet because i preferred the varying built-up applications i achieved with the dermablend professional cr&egrave;me, i missed something with trying this last.  as before i was too quick to judge.  i had applied it very thick and then i went out.  i thought to myself that is was mask-like, yet nice moist cover.

not only can i spot- apply this creamier-liquidy product to cover the face and problem areas with my fingers, i can also use a sponge blender for a more airbrushed look, then applying more product wherever as needed. i also can add a finishing touch of the dermablend professional set + refresh long-lasting make-up setting spray for a fresh stay; with or without powders. win-win-win.

5. loreal dermablend professional intense powdercamo!! (no spf):
this is a lovely and creamy intense powder in a nice mirrored compact with a sponge applicator, in separate compartments.  while this color is quite dark for me, one quality, besides the products ability to render a fine cover layer if desired, is that i do not see wrinkles really.  maybe the thin layer or the creaminess?  and the staying power, especially with the fresh mist of loreal dermablend professional set + refresh long-lasting make-up setting spray.  also, i can dab and smooth this powder wherever i want to whatever area of the face or neck.  the darker color, applied gently is making a nice bronzer if applied thin.  i do know that is stretching it though. i haven't tried it over the above loreal dermablend professional liquid camo product, since this is a very dark color; however, i suppose this might possibly work; though this does go on thin, and i do not think a cr&egrave;me or foundation is needed to get a good look. very nice camo cover product!

6. loreal dermablend professional quick-fix body (no spf):
wow again.  i hadnt understood at first how i can use this, as one of the colors i own is a darker bronze; and while i hadnt yet noticed the medium (my shade).  i mistakenly applied some of the dark under my cheekbones to see a defined look which actually worked for me, yet thick as i applied it - and silly me! i am thinking that since this product says body in the title it is going to be nice for use on varicose veins and other body imperfections like a permanent rash i have. double win with this product results!

this is a creamy roll-up stick cover product which does the job without rubbing off too much. i love the idea of having a smooth body-skin look as with the generous tube of the wonderful, and long-lasting dermablend professional leg and body make-up; however, im mentioning this quick fix product first as im partial to a more natural, yet youthful, look, only working with the blemishes and letting the natural skins still show through.  this is my personal preference.  it isn't quite going to be looking as flawlessly airbrushed overall as with the full body make-up, yet it is the product i will use first; especially during the day. i love it.

7. loreal dermablend professional leg and body make-up (spf25):
it is so nice to wear tights, stockings, or nylons during the winter to have confidence that leg imperfections will not be seen with dresses, and on ankles under pants above boots.  however, during cooler months especially, it is very nice to see perfect body skin peeking out of your clothing.  not only does this product render a flawless airbrushed look, it is actually very resistant to liquid or rubbing off onto hands or clothing.  i absolutely loved the look when i put it on; and then darn, i was noticing in the light that my shade was a bit peachier than my actual sallow skin.  this might not be problematic for you with full-body applications, as for me on an occasional basis as desired; yet finding your closest match will save you a lot of bother, and will please you i believe.  as i have expressed that this product renders a nice, airbrushed look, and i believe even because of the staying power alone this dermablend pro product is worth looking into.  it just didn't muss up and rub off.

8. loreal dermablend quick-fix concealer stick (spf 30)
this works fabulously; it is creamy and it stays put; it is smart just as the loreal dermablend professional cover cr&egrave;me, because it has that strength of sunscreen that my dermatologist recommends, even as i am in my home, shades drawn, as my dermatologist has warned about.  i have already sun damage under my right eye where there is a dark spot.  this covers very well, looks flawless with or without other products, yet it works synergistically with the wonderful loreal dermablend pro line. i have it in a tan color, and i would have thought since i usually use lighter shades of concealers that it would not have looked so perfect with my medium skin. lovely. plus 1,000%, and very smart.

very nice products indeed.  enjoy!",2017-07-03,5,5,ACJ9N7ED37HXS,B0002RI2PG
660,"i would never have thought that i could put white powder on my face and not look like a geisha! i didn't use the enclosed puff. i applied over foundation using a brush. use a light hand and brush away any white residue that remains. i've also applied it over l'oreal's visible lift radiance booster, which i use alone sometimes when i'm just running out to the post office, or trying on clothes at the store and don't want to get makeup on things. the setting powder takes away the shine of the l'oreal primer.

so, now i'm using green primer (to neutralize redness) and white powder. what next?!? i have very fair skin, so the white setting powder blends well. i don't know how it would work on darker or more olive complexions. i love that the mirror on the compact is large -- you can see your whole face in it. a lot of cosmetics companies are using smaller mirrors in their compacts, i suppose to save money.",2017-07-03,4,5,A36WTXJBYS3DB6,B0002RI2PG

translucent review: (see below for warm saffron review)

i have tried other translucent setting powders but i've never found one that satisfied me. either they were not fine enough or they left a white dusting on my face that i never could brush away. this setting powder is truly translucent. i do not use it every day - only for special occasions when i need my makeup to set for a very long time. that being said, i go through additional steps to achieve a longlasting, camera ready look. first of all, i do moisturize then apply a primer to keep my makeup looking smooth. i then apply concealer then foundation.

at this point is when i apply the setting powder. take the puff and apply powder liberally all over the forehead, undereye and cheek area, and the bridge of the nose. don't worry if you look like a clown. (btw, make sure that you are not wearing your going out clothes when doing this because the powder gets everywhere!)  leave it on for at least 5 minutes. the instructions say 2 but i leave mine on longer because i want it to "bake." while it is on there, i do my eyebrows and eyeliner. after 5 minutes, i then take a kabuki brush and start brushing off the excess until i look normal.

only then do i do my contouring and/or highlight. do not do your setting powder after contour and/or highlight because it will ruin all your shadowing effects.  i then apply lipliner and then lipstick and finish the whole thing with a really good setting spray for double insurance. this technique will ensure that your makeup lasts all day or all night.

warm saffron review:

as stated above, i have a medium complexion and of southeast asian descent. i regularly wear sunscreen so my skin is not quite tan. warm saffron is darker than my skin tone. however, i do like using it if i want a tanner look. i apply it with the pouf it comes with (after concealer & foundation) and then blend it out with my kabuki brush. unlike the translucent powder, i do apply it all over my face to get that even sunkissed look.  i use makeup (concealer, foundation, primer) that has yellow tones because my skin has a yellow undertone to it. warm saffron gives me that warm golden tan (without any of the sun damage)

if you are unsure about what shades will best suit you, go to the dermablend website, which will help you choose. i am in the middle spectrum, which ranges from 30-40 warm.",2017-07-02,5,5,A19RDMX22VXXSD,B0002RI2PG

664,"i tend not to be a fan of dermablend products.  that said,m one i do like is the setting powder.  this translucent one is, to me, by far the best.  the tinted powders tend to be heavily pigmented, so no matter how lightly application is attempted they can come off as dark.  this translucent one is much more easy to apply.  it does not cake, and has real staying power.  you will not find yourself reapplying it, or any makeup beneath it.

it goes on colorless and does not leave any white or paling residue, nor does it diminish the color/shading of your makeup.

it is a soft matte finish and it does truly last for 12 or more hours.

it is also one of the more reasonably priced dermablend products.",2017-06-30,5,5,A3T4OHEAHOJ700,B0002RI2PG

666,"i tried using this product when it first came out and loved it so much i used it professionally as a former makeup artist. in fact, i believe at one time it was only sold to professionals or you had to purchase from doctors or spas that carried the line. i was curious if it was the same formula that i had known and loved and i'm happy to say that it is! why apply a white powder over your makeup? this powder looks white in the jar but is invisible on the surface of the skin. i love it because it looks great over any type of foundation including airbrush makeup. any skin tone can use it too, even darker skin tones! what i really love is that this powder doesn't oxidize on the skin (turn orange or yellow). this is a problem with powders and foundations on oily skin, and it usually appears in my t zone if it shows up.

very little product is needed (tap that brush!) to get the desired result. if you don't like how it looks, you've used too much....less is more here. this powder doesn't dry my skin, either....it's delightfully invisible but gives a smooth, matte appearance. in a jar this size it will last a long time too since so little is needed. this is a wonderful powder for all skin tones and can even be worn over bare skin to matte the shine of oily skin if you prefer not to wear foundation. it's fragrance free and ideal for sensitive skin. 5 stars, highly recommended!",2017-06-30,5,5,A2GA64WZK8PKBC,B0002RI2PG

i use a giant facial brush to dust all over my face and neck to set all the makeup and powders.  you need to blend it in with the brush for a few seconds because it does go on a bit white but blends super easily - no worries there.

i just don't need it.  i am using the dermablend powder foundation and have found that just one powder is enough, i don't need the setting powder.

672,"this is a phenomenal setting powder that will keep your foundation and blush as flawless as when first applied. it makes your pores all but disappear. right now it is hot and humid and with this setting powder my makeup keeps going strong 'till i get home in the evening. it also keeps my foundation (dermablend) from smudging, and i find that very important because i do public contact work. it goes on white but is actually colorless. the packaging is really generous compared to other brands that i have tried. i've found that dermablend products are truly worth the expense because they give you great coverage with only a slight application. i wholeheartedly recommend this powder because it so tremendously enhances your appearance!

note about the application process: when using this setting powder, cover the area with foundation very well and allow it to set for a few minutes. then gently brush off the excess to get the best results.",2017-06-25,5,5,AKMEY1BSHSDG7,B0002RI2PG
673,"from the female of the family. you can use this setting powder for a number of dermablend makeup products. i got it to go with the company's liquid leg makeup, as it was transferring to sandal straps, shorts hems, etc.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/dermablend-leg-and-body-makeup-liquid-foundation-with-spf-25-for-medium-coverage-all-day-hydration-45n-medium-bronze-3-4-fl-oz/dp/b06xnrs7xv/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8">dermablend leg and body makeup liquid foundation with spf 25 for medium coverage & all-day hydration, 45n medium bronze, 3.4 fl. oz.</a>.

they say the powder will fix makeup and prevent transfer for up to 16 hrs (i've tried for about 8 at a stretch and it works). however, there are two issues that made me knock off a star: 1) applying it to two full legs, over makeup, is messy! you could stand on an old towel i guess. i have a large bathtub so i sit on one side with my legs over the tub and put it on. when done, i can flush the speckles of dropped powder down the drain using the handheld shower nozzle. 2) it's kind of hard to get off! my best bet is to get in the shower at the end of the day and scrub my legs with body wash on a brush, or rough facecloth.

it's good for what it claims to do, and it would probably be a lot easier to apply and remove over face makeup.

679,"as a man i was hesitant to use. but i am also embarrassed by my cherry red face this time a year. so i had to try something. i'm glad i tried this. i first use their dermablend blurring mousse with spf 25. that covered the redness and gave me some protection on top of the zinc sunblock i already use. that zinc stuff leaves me looking super shiny with a white coating on top of my red face - not good. the blurring mousse covers the white sunblock and red face, this setting powder removes the oily shine. result is - i look like i have a nice natural face free of redness and oil. my redness is natural and the sun just makes it worse, add my oily skin and well, i get self conscious. so i am loving this stuff. this powder leaves my face looking dry. truth is it's also lasting all day even with light sweat. when i pat my face i barely see a hint of color, so its not wearing off nor getting on my collar. would definitely recommend to a woman, wouldn't admit to my friends i'm using it though, but i don't plan to stop. at least not until summer passes. i am totally satisfied with how long it last how well it stays on and the fact that it doesn't "look" like i  have anything on. i love it!",2017-06-21,5,5,AQCYEZYS51OBC,B0002RI2PG
680,"applied this dermablend to half my face, just so i could accurately review my own experience in a comparison with my usual makeup routine. to be fair, note that i don't have the dermablend foundation and instead used my own mineral liquid foundation, so my results may not be as they'd be with someone who uses both together.

what i found is:
-i couldn't really see a marked difference between one side of my face and the other, as far as how it looked, and i looked under different lights. it may have been a little different but it was so slight that it made it negligible. i didn't want to apply more, but maybe it calls for more, or it calls for the dermablend foundation to work together.
-the side with the dermablend powder did set my makeup better. when i took a white tissue and rubbed across both sides of my face, the side without the dermablend powder had more come away on the tissue than on the side that had the dermablend powder.
-i didn't see any caking or noticeable powder residue, but i buffed my face really well with a buffing makeup brush after the 2-3 minutes of setting. i will suggest to women who say they have peach fuzz on their face to consider epilators - they run from the gamut of prices so you can find one. having a smooth face helps your makeup go on smooth, and the powders won't sit atop the skin.
-i didn't feel made up - it didn't sit heavy on my skin.
-it's messy. be careful opening it the first time, and every time really. the big white powder puff thing is ridiculously puffy-big and you have to work the lid back on over it - i'll likely throw that away and use my big buffing brush on the days i want to use a powder - like if it's going to be humid and i need extra setting (this wouldn't be something i'd need in the dry weather times in the mountains, but i could see needing this when i visit down south in the humidity!).
-the color looked dark on the white puff when i first looked at it, but on my face it blended nicely.

it's difficult to review this fairly, really, without having the dermablend foundation. my experience using my own foundation was mixed. but, the dermablend isn't super expensive and there's enough to last a very long time.

if you need a setting powder and like the dermablend brand, then i do recommend this. otherwise, i'm neutral about this product, since i am very happy with the way my regular foundation looks and sets. however, as written above, i'd use this when visiting down south where it is super humid and i need a little more setting to keep my makeup from sliding off!",2017-06-20,3,4,A1A25TP5D0L22V,B0002RI2PG

682,"i live in florida where the humidity is really bad. i have often found that my makeup basically comes off from the heat and humidity and cannot seem to find anything that will stay in place during the day. i have to say that this product was wonderful. it is easy to apply and feels light which is a big plus. i don not like when makeup feels caked on. the only thing i did not like about the product is that it comes with an applicator, which is basically a large powder puff. after you apply the powder you place it back on top of the powder. it is separated by a plastic sieve for the better part of the word. so when you want to reapply again the powder puff will have excess powder left over from your first application. having to dusk off the excess you would be wasting powder. so my advice to dermablend would be to have a switch inside to close the sieve when you place the powder back in.",2017-06-19,4,4,A25NT9MZV9RTR7,B0002RI2PG

it comes with a large poof, but i would suggest using a light brush as the poof was a bit awkward for me and gives you less control. this product does contain talc, so if you're allergic to talc, this may not be the product for your.

the directions say this product is meant to set other dermablend products but i used it with a different brand of bb cream and it worked well.",2017-06-17,5,4,A1501C38OCSEMA,B0002RI2PG

729,"quick fix for an uneven and terrible haircut! i received a very bad student haircut that went from medium full to shorter than military with exposed scalp. i stumbled across this stuff on amazon and bought a competitors as well. this one worked well but was actually enhanced by the other one. this was mostly because the other was a shade different in color and combined created a more natural result. my hair was shorter in one side than the other and the student actually took a 'chunk' out. i looked terrible! this stuff actually created the illusion. of an even look and concealed my visible scalp while my hair is growing back. it is worth a try! hair spray makes it stick and once dry will not transfer. step 1. shake over your washed, dried, and styled, hair like you are sifting in a back and forth motion. step 2. pat gently but firmly into place. step 3. wipe any product off your forehead, ears, neck and be prepared to do it again. step 4. seal it with a mist of quality hair spray ( you do not need theirs!!). paul mitchell freeze and shine worked great!

allow to dry or hit it with the hair dryer!
once dry feel free to shake your head over the sink to prove nothing is coming lose!

you're now good to go! yes, your hair will feel a little more crunchy than normal,but for me i didn't care. this saved me from a lot of embarrassment and i recommend it to at least try. i don't think it will cover a bald head unless you want to look like you glued hair sprinkles on,

749,"i want to give an honest assessment because i know how hair loss affects each of us. i've been losing my hair since i was 20 and have done everything under the sun to fight it off. i've reached a point in my life, after some surgeries, where i've got about 30-40 percent density over the entire top of my head and a little less in the back. i have run out of donor hair and was stuck with either having to wear a hair system or use a masking product. when i first started using this i was prepared to give it a lower rating. it didn't seem to apply evenly and ran very easily with a little sweat or water. after applying it a dozen times it got easier and was more effective so don't necessarily give up after the first couple of tries.

first of all, toppik won't cover a completely bald head. you have to have some hair already for it to look even slightly natural. i hold the bottle about 2 inches off my head and tap the side of the bottle and move it around to try and apply it evenly. you should use bright lighting when you apply it and use a hand mirror so you can check the top of your head a few times as you're applying it. it makes your hair look very powdery at first so i lightly rub the top of my hair to get some of it to fall down into the scalp. then, and this is very important, you have to use a good shiny hair spray. i put 2-3 applications on to counteract the dull look from the toppik powder. the more hair you already have the easier this process is, and the more natural it will look. don't go swimming with it or stand out in a heavy rain shower for very long, or it will clump and/or run at some point as the hair spray wears off. i would encourage you to do at least 3-4 trial runs before going into public, and order a couple different colors to try. also, i sometimes use dermmatch (scalp concealer) as a first step to apply a base coat since it is even more water proof and is less expensive. then the toppik on top of it provides more texture. i use a lot of toppik on each application. a medium size bottle of it lasts me about 5-6 weeks applying it almost every day.",2016-02-29,4,5,AF3APPUEZ4WU4,B0002ZW5UQ

i attach the sprayer, cover my head in a fine mist, pat, comb. i continue to apply where needed and then spray with the fiber fix (or hairspray, if in a pinch, works fine). my hair is shiny and i am ready to face the world without being embarrassed about my mostly bald head. i now look like i have hair where there is none, or very little.

  i started purchasing from amazon and found the product more reasonably priced.  amazon also has a pump that screws onto the toppik bottle and you can direct the powder better to the areas where you need it most.  i use a little hair spray to help hold it in place.  i found the medium brown covers my scalp better than the light brown and blends better with my hair color and highlights.  i would be lost without this product.  one negative i don't think can be avoided, is the powder can make your hair look a little dull at the roots, but the alternative would be the appearance of  thinning hair.  i order the refills and re-use my container.",2015-06-07,5,5,A31M40X061BW0H,B0002ZW5UQ

803,"i use this every day, but i also shower at night and "no-poo" my baby fine hair every few days. if you do not, then the fibers might get on your pillowcase.

with a new bottle, i peel off the plastic tape that is covering the shaker, then tape off 1/2 of the opening with blue painter's tape - otherwise too much will come out too fast.

you do not actually shake this on to your hair, but instead into your  part lines. part your hair, hold the bottle at 45 degrees or so, and gently tap the fibers into the part while holding your other hand over your forehead to keep fibers off from there. you may have to do a quick wipe of your forehead with a tissue. if you have a lot of fibers on your forehead, you are tapping too much and too hard - or you didn't seal off 50% of the shaker with painter's tape. it does not take a lot to make your hair look fuller, just a tap-tap-tap and them move on to the next area.

this would not work well for extensive baldness (nothing does!), but works well for the dreaded "wide part" problem. dark hair would be more of a challenge on a light-skinned person, as the contrast between hair and scalp would make the fibers show more than with medium brown hair.

they have a really small travel-size that i carry in my handbag, so you can try it without spending much $...you would not have to tape the shaker part on that one!

one suggestion for toppik company is to make the darn container transparent - it is completely opaque, so there is no way to know when you are running out, except to shake it in the sink. dumb, as people would order sooner, if they knew they were running low.",2014-11-06,5,3,A2PFKD76DMWIEF,B0002ZW5UQ

update 5/13/2017: i don't know when amazon increased their price but they need to reconsider! i had been buying it from amazon loyally but a $38 increase from the toppik website price is crazy! went to the company website and autosubscribed to get the same product for $71/month instead of the $115 amazon now charges. very disappointed.",2014-08-18,4,1,AIO1DYYJQVTP6,B0002ZW5UQ

822,"i have very thin hair on the top and front of my head. i'm a 41 yr old female with female pattern baldness. i have medium brown  curly hair. based on previous reviews i chose light brown. i'm happy i did me because it blended perfectly. to apply i found the spray applicator works best for me. i dry and style my hair and then gently lift sections up and holding the sprayer 3-6" above my hair, give shallow "poofs" to the shaft and 2-3" in length from my scalp. then i lay the hair back in the desired style and generally mist the hair in the thinnest spots-patting the hair to gently push it into the hair itself. then light spray with hairspray. i have also not used hair spray and it stayed in place as well. it has never come off on my pillow or my clothes. the only issue i have is getting too close to my scalp- it can become polka dots in my bald spots if not careful. if you have a small bald spot this would be fine, but my hair is so thin i would need a lot of product to cover my scalp. toppik plumps the hair i have and dusts my scalp in color to minimize my scalp showing. my husband thinks it looks really natural- he didn't know what i had done but kept saying how good my hair looked. he was surprised when i told and showed him the product. he had no idea it was fibers! part of what really makes my hair look thicker is that this product is great to make your hairline part look thinner and thus making your hair appear fuller. to keep a straight part line, lay a pipe cleaner on top of your part or use a piece of paper to cover the part line and then apply to toppik over the paper/pipe cleaner. you will be amazed how minimizing your part maximizes the look of your hair! it's a good solution with little effort. depending in your type of thinning/balding will determine if the product is successful for you. the product does attach to the hair you have and does appear thicker and it does not come off until you wash it. it did exactly what it promised to. good luck!",2014-05-16,5,4,A8PHIF1PTRRW4,B0002ZW5UQ

844,"i went through a major hair shed a couple of years ago, which was when i got my first toppik fibers. this product has helped preserve my vanity by hiding my widening part and other thin spots on my head. toppik blends in so nicely and stays put until your next wash. i don't use the spray nozzle attachment, i just sprinkle it on and pat it out to blend in, as they demonstrate in the video on toppik's website.

i've never seen residue on my clothing or pillowcase (however, fine dust does fly everywhere when applying it, so get dressed after application!). the stuff doesn't even bleed out after a tough, sweaty workout either. as far as the colors, after some trial and error, i mostly use medium brown, which is more of a dark than a golden brown shade. i've also tried light brown, but that shade is more of a dark ash blonde and i had to blend the medium and light to make it work. i ended up dyeing my hair a little darker so i can stick to the medium brown and keep things simple.

the only negative is that the fine dust settles on my white bathroom counters after application, but is easily cleaned up. right now amazon has the best price on this product, costing $10 less than at beauty supply stores. i've also tried caboki, which for me was of inferior quality, lasting power and had a funny rubber-like smell (toppik has no scent whatsoever).",2013-07-12,5,5,A1FDWNNQ50ATXS,B0002ZW5UQ

846,"this stuff is great for thinning hair, but you need some hair for it to adhere to.  it's keratin, which i believe is a protein that is part of the structure of hair and it looks very natural, if you choose the right color.  even a hairdresser couldn't tell i was using it until she washed my hair.  it comes out easily with shampoo, but can last for a day or two if you don't wash your hair.  it makes your hair look so much thicker and that is saying something.  my hair is so thin in the back that my scalp shows through, but with toppik, you can't tell.  even if someone was sitting behind you, like in church, i don't think they would pick up on the fact that you are using it.  men, if your head is totally bald, you know, shiny, i don't think this is for you, but if you are thinning and still have a fair amount of strands of hair left, this could work for you.  be sure to get the color closest to the rest of your hair.  i believe they even have grey.  i use either the dark brown or the light brown depending on the shade that i have my hair dyed.  also, it doesn't come off on my pillow like the joan rivers junk, and the medium size can lasts pretty long. it's expensive, sort of, but worth it.  definitely cheaper than a wig or toupee.  as soon as i open a new container, i order another one, just to make sure that i never run out.  the best price i have found is on this website. sally's beauty supply is much more expensive, as is the toppik website.",2013-05-20,5,5,A2FP9UXBM2OBYI,B0002ZW5UQ
847,"works great to hide thinning hair patches. just shake on the areas that are thinning. works by concealing balding scalp areas - the micro fibers lay on top of your scalp darkening the area so your otherwise shiny noggin doesn't show thru the thinning hair. also somewhat thickens the appearance of hair. withstands wind pretty well & moisture to some degree. washes out easily with shampoo and water. will also rub off on your hands if you run your hands thru your hair. is purely a cosmetic fix to hiding hair loss. for it to work well, it's necessary for there to be some hair, even if it is fine and short, present to which the fibers can adhere and fill in. best for concealing small patches. causes me no irritation and don't even know i'm using it.

it helps to apply a fine hairspray to keep toppik topic in place, but i rarely need to do this. if i do, i use a tresemme extra fine mist spray. the scent is mild and doesn't leave you with old lady aquanet smelling helmet hair. you can use any hairspray you like - consort, american crew, etc.

to get the best control over where the fibers go, it's best to hold the can as close to the head as possible and ever so lightly aggitate the can to shake just enough and where you want it. there is no reason to hold it high above the head - in fact, if you do, fiber will go every which way and may go where its not needed. they make a special applicator for the can to "spray" the fiber, but i find it more efficient to just apply keeping the regular can shaker top close to the head. for the front close to the hairline, it's best to apply back away from the hairline at first and let the fibers naturally fall forward as needed. if you apply too close to the hairline, it may look too fake. you can always come a bit closer and apply.

works well for men and women alike. has no scent.

get the color that best matches your hair color. you can use 2 different colors if you are looking for a special match, but i find the dark brown works just find for my typical dark brown hair.

i'm a 40 yr old guy with thinning hair, but i still want to wear a pomp. fortunately, i just have some thinning patches and not extensive balding such as mpb on top. toppik works for me even if i use pomade to get the pomp look i like. i apply toppik after greasing up and getting my hair partially styled. i'll add toppik as needed to the thinning spots as i comb and style. the pomade actually seems to help keep toppik adhering better and covers my thinning patches well. i've found that using a water based pomade as a base works best and then using a petrolatum/wax based pomade as a topper for shine really helps. i add the toppik after applying pomades. you can add more pomade if you need to, but i usually then need to add a bit more toppik since some will inevitably come out on your hands when applying pomade to hair that already has toppik applied.

the stuff is not waterproof and will come out if you get your head soaked.

face it guys, there's no miracle cure for hairloss - yet. toppix is a good cosmetic choice for hiding hairloss, but if you're bald or otherwise don't have at least some hair to which toppix can blend into, this may not work for you. you can always buy one of the smaller sizes to try out if unsure.",2013-05-01,5,5,A1FEI4HDXTA454,B0002ZW5UQ

851,"purchased for my elderly mother who constantly laments her thinning hairline. although this is obviously a superficial solution, it does make her feel like she has more hair in front. a little tricky to apply (it is a fine powder, afterall), and tends to get all over the place. but used judiciously, desired results can be achieved with some practice. not sure if she will repurchase, but at least for now it offers an easy solution for bald spots. it basically just colors your scalp like shoe polish, doesn't really thicken fine hair as claims.",2013-04-06,4,3,A3QXLSQVR1RX5M,B0002ZW5UQ
852,"my hair dresser told me about toppik's hair building fibers because one of her clients has had success using it.  toppik is intended to make your scalp appear as if it has hair in the right places.  this illusion is created by the tiny keratin particles bonding to your own hair.  if your scalp is actually bald and there is no hair that is combed over it, this product isn't going to work for you.  that said, it does wonders for those of us with thinning hair.  just be sure to get the correct color that matches your own.  for example, the light blonde is strictly for those with very light, platinum blonde hair.  if your hair has the least bit of ash or red tone in it, opt for the medium blonde toppik.

after you have dried your hair (using all of the products you normally apply), sprinkle the toppik onto the areas that need to look fuller.  lightly tap the area to help the keratin particles `grasp' the hair.  once you have filled in these spaces, you may lightly style your hair.  vigorous brushing will remove toppik so, don't do it.  toppik should remain in place until you brush or shampoo.
applying toppik is fairly simple.  begin by sprinkling it a little at a time until you see the desired effect.  if you are placing it near your hairline, toppik offers a tool for putting it in a small, defined area.  (i just hold a tissue on my face to avoid having it settle on my skin.)  the top of the jar is wide so, if you want to cover a very small area, the tool could be quite handy.

for even greater results, i recommend toppik's hair fattener.  this is a leave-in treatment.  the results i have with it are impressive.  it works by making the hair appear a little thicker.  i have been using it for about six weeks and even my husband can see a small difference in the thickness of my hair.  (toppik's claim is that continued use will make a permanent change in the thickness of the hair.) using both products together will really help you look like you have no gaps of hair.

i still use another product (a colored powder) that i brush onto my scalp to help cover the sparser areas in front.  but, i use far less of it with toppik's products.

853,"my stylist told me about toppik when she noticed how thin my hair was getting to be. she purchased the 0.36oz/10.3g for me from the local beauty supply. even with her discount it was almost $25. but i really liked how toppik camouflages my thin spots. only a couple of people have noticed that there is something different with my hair. only one person realized what the difference was, and only because she'd also used toppik.

toppik is now a must-have product for me so i started looking for a better bargain and found it here. i get almost more than twice the product for only a few $ more.

i would definitely recommend toppik to anyone.",2013-03-24,5,5,AA8TVGYLXMEU7,B0002ZW5UQ

857,"i have been using this product for over a year now, and i recommend it to anyone that has thin hair on the top of the head.  the color blends in well with my own haircolor, and it adds body and texture to my own thin strands. i do try and add a side part using a thin comb or pick in order for a more natural look, otherwise it can sometimes look like a wig without a natural hairpart.
i am a young woman, and without this product i would go back to  feeling  very self -conscience and uncomfortable in public.
note: would probably not work as well on bald heads or severe hair loss.",2012-12-23,5,5,ABS0ZTJI0XVXF,B0002ZW5UQ

-it doesnt flake everywhere like some of the other products do.

-it doesnt rub off onto clothes
you want to make sure you get it on the roots/scalp.. brush hair afterward to knock off "extra" and use hairspray.  it will look awesome and stay put. been using this for 2 years now and tried several types before i found this... if i was a "prep per" i would stock food, water, emergency supplies and this for the vanity side of me.",2012-12-10,5,5,A30BXEGRRRJIV8,B0002ZW5UQ

862,"my husband has been using toppik for awhile now. it is an incredible waste of money because this product would work only for people with very small bald spots. my husband uses it to cover the whole top of his head, which looks like brown fungus growing out of his hair. and in the sun, it actually turns a pinkish red (he uses dark brown)! the claim that it can withstand rain or shine is a complete lie. even with a bit of wind or humidity, the hair fibers leak down the sides of his face, making it look like tar. it leaves a mess in the bathroom and on pillows and sheets. i would not recommend this product just for the sake of sanity because my husband truly believes that i still don't know that he uses the product! toppik has really exacerbated his vanity about losing his hair. using toppik has had a huge pyschological impact on him because he is always ducking his head in front of any strong wind, constantly wearing hats when he is not using the product, and is constantly checking to make sure the fibres are in place. instead of just accepting the fact that hair loss is natural and inevitable and that it doesn't even bother me, my husband constantly obsesses over his hair. instead of enhancing his look, toppik makes his hair look incredibly fake and the fibers fall all over the place. instead of boosting his confidence, toppik has made him even more insecure about losing his hair.",2012-06-10,1,3,A3P89WPE2YL003,B0002ZW5UQ
863,"i ordered my first can of toppick hair building fibers based on the mostly good reviews by other users.  i agree that this is a good product.  it's not great, it doesn't make me suddenly look like i have lots of hair, but i must say that it is better than the hair i "naturally" have now.  apparently due to aging, my once very thick hair has thinned drasically in the past ten years, and i have tried many, many products in an effort to either regrow hair, or to give the illusion of more hair.  toppick is applied after shampooing, drying and styling, and on top of any other hair thickening products.  it is a fine powder that is manually shaken from the can. toppick is sold in several different color shades and "light brown" is the first shade that i tried, as i have light brown hair with blond highlights, neither of which are my natural shade.  after the first few shakes, i discovered that there were more hair building fibers all over my shoulders, shirt and the bathroom than on my head.  i invested in the applicator made to fit over the top of the can and i urge anyone who is interested in trying toppick, to do the same.  the nozzle-tip applicator makes it much easier and neater to apply this product.  the major plusses of toppick are that it hides my shiny pink scalp and i find that the fibers do give the illusion of more hair.  the minuses include:  1.  i need to use a lot of toppick to achieve the desired results, making this product more expensive than i thought it would be; 2.  i need to use a special "spray" to get the fibers to stick in place, adding another expense; 3.  any time i comb or "fix" my hair during the day, the toppick fibers come out, so i need to reapply which is not easily accomplished when not at home; and 4.  the powder texture dulls the look of my hair.
  since the minuses are greater than the plusses, for me, i gave the toppick hair building fibers, light brown, only 3 stars.  will i continue to use this product?  absolutely - i haven't found anything else that hides my "naked" scalp and gives even a slight illusion of more hair as well as as the toppick fibers.  will i continue to use rogaine as well as other thickening and volume building products?  absolutely - at least until a magic potion is developed to successfully regrow hair, or my vanity weakens.  if you are a mature woman and your crowning glory has been reduced to just a few strands, i would highly recommend that you give toppick a try, just don't make your expecttions too high.",2012-05-28,3,3,A2WFZWRYWLC20S,B0002ZW5UQ

869,"i always re-order this product. my previous reviews no longer exist because the reseller is gone so i am going to c&p my original review.

i'm an african american male with thinning hair on the sides as well as top due to over processing my hair as a youth. it makes it difficult to get a nice even haircut and i can't where the low to bald styles since i have acne keloiditis around the rear hairline which causes hair loss and unattractive keloids. it's so embarrassing that i don't even like for people to stand behind me on the elevator. one day i discovered toppik and although no one in the videos had my type of hair i thought what the hell, it's worth a try.

toppik has completely changed my life. it's not perfect but look at it like makeup. it covers up just enough so that if you didn't tell people they wouldn't know. i have confided in 2 or 3 close friends that i started using it and asked if they saw any difference. they said "that stuff is f--- amazing!" if you have thinning or balding hair, scalp issues to cover up it's worth the money.

it's not gonna stay on overnight. it's not going to stay put on the sides or back under a hat. i've even tried holding spray and it will work but i personally have to gel my hair so hard that it's not favorable all the time. those are the only downsides. take it from me and my friends..it works and its amazing :)",2010-06-06,5,5,A2HVR0MZAO14S6,B0002ZW5UQ
870,"i've waited a bit to write this review.  i've got a good size bald/thinning spot on the crown of my head.  a couple of months ago i decided to try toppik after my barber recommended it.  it has taken a while to get the routine down and learn to apply it just right.  i've been very happy but yesterday proved to me what a great product this is.  i never told anyone what i was doing.  people kept asking me if i had just gotten a haircut.  they knew something had changd, but couldn't figure out what it was.

yesterday i was out for a walk qith my partner of 30 years and a friend.  while i was walking in front of them my partner said "what did you do to your hair?"  i cringed.  i thought that he had noticed that i had put something on it and it showed.  i aksed him what he meant.  he said that my bald spot was gone.  he then got right up on top of me and looked at my hair.  he could not tell what i had done, but my bald spot was gone.  my friend touched it and said that it was soft.  if i could fool them i could fool anyone.  even looking for it they couldn't tell.

like i said, it took a bit to get the application down just right.  this should not discourage you, you just need a little practice. i wash my hair, blow dry it and apply the toppik, using a hand mirror to see the back.  i use the toppik until i get good coverage, brush it and then use a light spray of tresseme hairspray.  it kind of seals it on the hair and keeps everything in place, but it is not stiff.  most days this is just a minute or so.  you don't need to blowdry if you just let your hair dry naturally, but don't use the toppik on wet hair.  i think that it would clump.  also the blow dryer give the hair a bit of volume which helps.

give it a try!",2010-02-01,5,3,AUOKN045TLJQ,B0002ZW5UQ

872,"i'm in my early 30's and have a receding hairline. you ever sleep with hairspray on your hair and to wake up next morning with linty hair? that's exactly how i would describe the texture when you use this on your hair. i purchased color black with the pump sprayer, pick/comb, and their hairspray. i accidently sprayed the toppik powder onto my scalp and noticed the toppik color was more like dark purple. it takes a while to perfect the use of the pump to get the right amount of toppik sprayed only onto the hair. no matter how perfect your results come out, up real close you can notice something different and i'm sure under the direct sunlight it's probably 10x more noticeable. toppik claims that people can't even notice 2 inches away, that's bull. this is definitely a better product than couvre the scalp concealer. toppik hairspray is like any other strong hold hairspray, absolutely nothing advanced or special about it. the comb is a piece of crap, made out of cheap paper/plastic not even worth a quarter! go to a dollar store and find yourself a better comb. toppik comes off easily so avoid moisture even your sweat, wind, and any objects & elements disrupting the do. the money and the time you have to spend to get a half decent look in my honest opinion is not worth it. i rather deal with a wearing a hat then worrying about an embarrassing toppik malfunction. maybe if you're in your 60's and not as concerned about the natural look then more power to you, but i still think people are over paying for a product that doesn't promise what they claim. i'm currently trying a product called nuhair. i'm taking the vitamin and using their hair serum. i'm only on the second month and hoping to see some results within the next few months. there are no cheap quick fixes that lasts forever so i'm going to commit to this nuhair program for 5-6 months and hope for the best. figure hair transplant takes up to 6 months anyways so might as well give the natural method a 6 month commitment. if the natural way fails then rogaine is a possibility and then hair transplant. bottom line, my girlfriend thinks i wasted my money on this product (toppik) and i'm going to have to agree with her on this. hope you guys learn from my mistake. if you guys know of any good hair transplant doctors in the bay area ca let me know. good luck fellas.",2009-04-13,2,1,A2XKRIJKX4HF8N,B0002ZW5UQ

944,"i'm not generally a neutral nail polish fan, but zoya shay won me over!  zoya's own website describes it as "dense, fleshy light peach with slight orange-red undertones and a hint of pearly silver shimmer."  to me it's a pale, slightly translucent, warm toned nude with a subtle shimmer.  i love it when i'm looking for something more classic or neutral (i.e. conservative work meeting, wedding, etc.) but still want a little hint of some interest, which is where the shimmer comes in.  my one fear in getting this was whether it would clash with my skin tone since that can be the one challenge with more nude/neutral toned polishes, but that concern was unfounded.  i think this looks great against my neutral toned light/medium skin and strawberry blonde hair.

application wise, it's consistent with the great user experience i've come to expect from zoya.  it is easy to apply evenly and doesn't go on streaky.  it is worth noting this polish is a little more on the sheer side so it seems to need a full 3 coats to be opaque, but i like the slightly sheer look you get with 2 coats.  given this is a more neutral, soft polish i think the slightly more sheer look works really well with this.

i purchased zoya nail polish after perusing their large color selection. their colors really are great - beautiful pigmentation, wide variety of colors, unique colors, etc.

is it worth it? i'm torn. i really do love the unique colors, but i wouldn't stock up on a ton of zoya colors. i'll pick a few of my favorites and deal with the coverage.

*layer 1 - some parts of my nail had glitter, others didn't. it looked awful so i decided to go for another layer.
*layer 2- now twila is starting to show up blue and glittery. it looks kind of weird though like there is no polish, just glitter. the glitter is hanging off of my nails in a couple of spots since there are glitter "bars" in this polish.
*layer 3- a few spots looked like they needed a third layer, but after trying the first nail i gave up on layer 3. it was too clumpy from layer 2 to fill in the spots.

the night that i painted my nails i was wishing that i hadn't. i was losing glitter everywhere and they just felt wrong. my nails were clumpy, bumpy and frustrating. by the end of day 2 my nails were highly chipped and it was time to remove the polish. while this one looks gorgeous online and in the bottle, it is not efficient. skip it.",2012-01-30,3,1,A39WWMBA0299ZF,B0006PJRVM
1027,"found this at ulta after considering an online purchase of zoya (after reading reviews).  gemma is an army green color, and in the bottle, you can see the contrast dichroic-type effect of pale purple shimmer.  however, once it's on the nails, that dichro effect is lost.  it simply looks like a shiny army green.  i think that the difference between regular ambient light in a room (or outdoors) and the pale purple shimmer is simply not great enough to show a difference.  if you're looking for army green, go for it.  if you're looking for dichroic effect, keep looking.

on the plus side, i did my nails last night and have spent about 10 hours typing since then, and they show no wear at all.  right now i'm using opi's natural nail base coat and top coat, but i have the zoya products on order (ulta didn't stock those).  i'm hoping the all-zoya combo will give me a super long wear.  i'll come back and report in when this one starts to show wear, and also after my first all-zoya manicure begins to show wear.  so far, i recommend!

edit.  zoya took a  really long time to ship out my stuff.  my gemma manicure lasted 10 days with only minimal edge wear (which only i could see; people talking to me couldn't tell).  i was bored with the color, so i went to ulta and bought "sarah" (a metallic red) and did that with orly's "top 2 bottom" base/top coat.  so far this has lasted 5 days and is not showing wear.

of course the zoya stuff showed up the next day.  so i stripped the "sarah" manicure off my right hand and used the zoya anchor base coat, 2 coats of sarah, and the armor top coat.  this has lasted 4 days so far (no wear).  i'm really impressed with the longevity of this nail polish.  i used to be an all-opi girl, but when their stuff started chipping within a day i decided it was time to look elsewhere.  zoya is now my top stop for new nail polishes.  just wish they'd either ship faster, or that ulta would stock 100% of their products!",2012-01-15,4,5,A2SH7OWE8QJYNC,B0006PJRVM

1060,"where shall i begin?! i have just shaved with this goodness minutes ago for the first time and god what a shave?! i don't know why the hell i haven't used it before since it's been laying in my den for atleast 4 months now!

for the first time proraso users you can kindly check my other reviews of this brand on amazon to get some kind of background facts with the history of this company, i will not talk about any formalities here and will head straight to the shave of this tube. my shave precisely consisted of the below:

razor : murkur futur chrome finish on setting 3
razor blade : kai on its third use
soap/cream: obviously the product you are hopefully wanting to purchase
pre shave : hot shower, proraso pre shave cream green (i did a detailed review of this on amazon feel free to check it out!)
bowl/scuttle: crown king scuttle ( you can also check the review i did on this product on amazon!)
brush: 28mm white mountain manchurian badger , bulb knot, lime green , sturdy design wiborg shaving custom brush.
post shave: extra cold water facial rinse, thayers lemon witch hazel astringent.
aftershave splash: irisch moos
after shave balm: phoenix cad mentholated aftershave balm.

sorry for those who don't really wet shave , we wet shavers always post our shaves in exact details listed above to share with others with the same interest. when do we do this? we do this after an amazing shave , mostly when using a product for the first time. this allows others in our community to try and match as much as they can their shaves to the ones we performed.
in other words wet shaving is all about experience and atleast me personally having a huge number of products in my den , it's always a pleasure when you line up such tools to use for a shave for the first time , and one that ends up on top of your shaving experience. hence since i am lucky with this first try , if i ever want to shave with the proraso green cream again, if i use all these matching products another time , i am guaranteed an amazing shave.

after i shared with you all of this , the review is all about the cream, i will make sure on the other hand that i will publish reviews on all the other products listed above on amazon in the coming days, so it will help you understand every factor and function of the shave which to me has been a huge success.

usually i always start my shave by choosing products that i feel with experience would form my ultimate shave, humbly speaking i can assume the outcome of other products if they were to be chosen. let's say another razor or a different type of brush. i am lucky that my choices today led me to a great shave and i wish it never ended :(

anyways the cream unlike the green soap of proraso has clear differences in scent , form, and structure. first off the scent is less powdery and soapy, more cologne oriented than the green tub. it still stands out even with the green pre shaving cream i added before hand.
unlike the soap this cream also has a different form of sheen , it's not thick it's silky and white. with the right amount of water i have to admit it has more slickness yet maintaining a safe cushion. the cushion on the green soap is more evident than the cream.
the slickness on this cream is more persistent here and allows more razor glide ease. no matter how well experienced with my shaving technique i am , still i do always respect a new shave and i am always careful with every move i do, to avoid cuts and burns.

i recommend this product specifically to those that are new to wet shaving because the cream is easy to lather. i usually refrain from bowl lather in general but this cream lathers in the bowl in no time, infact the process usually requires adding drops of water to the lather, in this case all i did was make sure my skittle was damp, along with my brush, i squeezed a dulop in the middle of the bowl and started working, i was able to create enough lather for the neighborhood  in less than a minute and half!

enjoy and shave on!",2016-10-26,5,5,A3Z96U2AVVDJP,B0007M11XQ
1061,"initially when i tried proraso green and white i wasn't impressed.  it left a film over my equipment and i felt i could get better results from van der hagen gylerin (which is excellent btw).  after almost a year of wet shaving i have come back to try proraso since my technique has improved.  now i hand lather which allows me to "feel" when the lather is ready and i make sure i have peaks.  this takes 1-2 minutes.  this made a huge difference in the quality of the shave.  much more cushion and protection; plus no white film everywhere.

this is now my favorite shave cream.  i will get the white as well as i really liked that one last year too.

oh, and for you vegans out there - this has no animal byproducts.  the stearic acid in proraso is plant derived (proraso customer service replied to my inquiry).

i highly recommend this product.  its really a toss up between the proraso cream and the soap.  the cream seems to lather a little faster but soap is easier to travel with.  plus its easier for me to control the amount i load into the brush with the cream.  if you're new to wet shaving you i suggest you start with this product.",2016-09-15,5,5,A14JDMEHQJRR3T,B0007M11XQ

1085,"a while back, frustrated by razor burn and ingrown hairs, i took to the internet to find a solution. i had a heavy beard, with skin that was dry and sensitive. i hated shaving, my face was read, burning and bleeding when i was done shaving, and i couldn't use an expensive blade for more than a week. one thing i was introduced to was wetshaving. wetshaving can best be described as "old time" shaving. wetshaving is far superior to the shaving technique that most men use today, and has greatly improved my shaving experience, and i don't dread shaving like i used to.

wetshaving soon became the search for the perfect shave. trying to get a balance between a smooth well groomed face, and no irritation. in fact, as many can attest, it soon became an obsession. over the last few years i have tried dozens of different razors, shaving creams,  pre-shave oils,shaving bowls, badger brushes, aftershave balms and lotions, to find the perfect shave. i have bought everything from the highest end shaving creams at thirty or forty dollars a jar, to five dollar shave soaps. having said all of that, proraso is my favorite cream of all. it is an italian produced cream that is very well respected by those who are "shaving gourmets."

the one thing that you must know about proraso is it has menthol, and eucalyptus, and lots of it. it has been described as having a cooling or even bracing sensation, so much so that some guys don't like to use it in the winter. it also has a very strong and unique smell. some say it smells medicinal, i think it smells like an italian sewer to be honest. so why do i think it is the best cream? well, 1st it is a great value for the money. while it may look expensive, when using a brush, you only need an almond sized amount in your bowl for a clean shave. so a tube will last you 3 months easy. it is essentially no more expensive than the dried out gunk they sell in aerosol cans at your local drugstore and yet it performs as well as something 3x's the price. second, it produces a rich lather that has a slickness to it, which i believe is one of the most important parts of a good shave. a slick shaving cream means less drag from the razor. third, it is great for guys like me who have thick beards. some prefer a lighter lather, but i have found that with a thick beard you need all the protection you can get. fourth, it comes in a tube, which i prefer to a shaving soap (soaps dry out my face) and to tubs. i travel a lot and i find it easier to travel with a tube then with a tub, just fits in my dop bag better for some reason. also, i have found that creams you get in a tube (and proraso especially) can still give you a good shave without a brush. some other brands say they will give you a good shave with or without a brush, but not true in my experience. i don't take my brush with me when i travel, and the fact that i can still get a good lather while traveling is a big plus. fifth, i like the cooling (bracing effect) that i described earlier. if you are like me and ingrown hairs and razor burn are your main worries, washing off your face with cold water after you shave is nice, kind of like putting an ice pack on an inflamed knee, it dulls the irritation. finally, it works great with the other products in the line. i have never liked pre-shave oils because, while they do protect the face, they make it harder to apply shaving cream and gunk up your razor. however, with the proraso preshave it is different. it is not an oil, but a paste, so it seems to come off easier (however, take it easy with the preshave, put on too much and it will actually produce a burning sensation from all the menthol). also, i really like the proraso aftershave, not too thick not too thin. put them all together and you can get a very good shave. if you don't want to spend the money on the proraso aftershave, the nivea sensitive balm is great too and half the price and available at most drug stores.

one thing that i must mention is that proraso is sold in america as bigelow shaving cream. when i bought a bottle from here i was disapointed that when it arrived from the seller (lci) it was damaged and unusable. i use amazon for the convenience, i don't have time to box stuff up and ship it back.  so i went to the store that carries this product, and found that they had a buy 2 get 1 free sale. so i tossed this one, and just got 3 of the bigelow creams (exact same ingredients) for 20 bucks plus tax. now i am set for the next few months.",2013-02-18,5,5,A3JGDBZM9CGRXU,B0007M11XQ
1086,"this lathers well and does not jam up the razor.  my wife loves the smell.  i will definitely buy this again.",2012-12-23,5,5,A1WAA32LZ1488K,B0007M11XQ
1087,"this product is awesome and a small $5 tube can be purchased at bath and body works under their co bigelow line if you just want to try it. it has a great old fashioned smell, lathers well with your fingers (even better with a brush), and rinses off cleanly leaving a nice feeling face! great shave for the money but if you're willing to pay a little more try taylor of old bond street. art of shaving products are overpriced and don't work as well as these!

shaving- let me save you years of trial and error: take a warm shower & wash your face with billy jealousy exfoliating facial cleanser, shave afterwards with a $50 merkur safety razor handle with good blades (save $100's on mach 3 refills!), use a $20 tweezerman badger hair shaving brush to apply taylor of old street bond (or proraso) shaving cream (you can let it set in a minute), shave with the grain down, slowly, softly (don't press hard- let the weight of the handle and sharp blade do the cutting), lastly rub on a fingertip of proraso pre/post shave cream while your face is still wet and let it dry! say goodbye to razor bumps and ingrown hairs forever! trust me- i've tried dozens of pricey face washes, shaving creams, and after shaves over the last 4 years. if you don't want to commit so much money yet- order the pre/post shave proraso cream online, buy proraso shave cream online or at bath and body works (under their c.o. bigelow label) then get the cheap single blade disposables (mach 3's are too aggressive) at a grocery store and you'll notice a difference overnight.",2012-12-03,5,5,A1DMRK2YINRC16,B0007M11XQ
1088,"there's no doubt that this cream is top-notch.  i've used inferior brands (inferior in terms of cost) such as gillette and barbasol, and gillette was pretty good until i tried proraso.  perhaps it's my skin, but when i initially applied it, while still providing a soothing effect, the cream maintained a subtle sharpness.  it might've been the combination of the cream and a new badger brush.
nevertheless, when i shaved i could feel my skin a lot smoother than before.  it might take some getting used to, but i can already tell the superior quality of this product.

a bonus is that it's really easy to clean from the sink.  after a night's shave i thought i had cleaned up all of it from the sink, but the next morning i found clumps i didn't see before.  thinking it was going to give me a hassle to remove as my previous shaving cream had (barbasol), i grabbed some toilet paper and pressed firmly across it.  i realized i didn't need to push down hard, and it wiped cleanly off with ease.

1089,"i started using proraso shaving cream about two years ago after i stopped shaving with disposable cartridge systems. i used my departure from gillete to kick my traditional edge shaving gel to the curb and instead picked up proraso based on the positive reviews here.

two years later i'm glad to say that i'm still as happy as ever with proraso. i'm using proraso with a badger hair brush, a merkur razor and sharp razor blades. my resulting shave is ridiculously smooth and pleasantly devoid of irritation that i experiened with gillete blades. much of that has to do with proraso's cream which forms a thick foam with a small dime-sized dollop of cream. the menthol and eucalyptus formula leaves a fresh, tingling feeling when applied and continues post shave.

best of all one 5.2 ounce tube of proraso can last close to a year with regular shaving. the initial cost per tube is higher than typical brands but the cost is easily made up over the course of a year.",2010-12-16,5,5,A2Q2A6JKY95RTP,B0007M11XQ

as for face... this or any one other product won't replace an aesthetician because a great aesthetician will vary her treatments. mine deals with a variety of peels at different strengths, natural products, and once in a while we do microdermabrasion. plus massaging for oxygen flow and firmness, and so on. i learn so much from her. she can see what's hormone versus diet, stress, rosacea, what to watch out for. i went from acne to clear over time with her.

also it's just good to vary products. weather changes, humidity, age, stress, diet and other factors keep us in our toes so i would say this product is good among others, based on what i need at that time.

not criticizing the product, i did give it 5 stars, just not a save-all. i'd say incorporate it into the routine but vary your treatments and keep an open mind. this one is a little strong for daily. i'd say it's a good 1-2x week routine for the face.

neutralize after use. (i don't only on my back)

1111,"so, as i was searching the internet one night for a product to help my adult cystic acne, i came across these glycolic acid treatment pads. the reviews were great, and they were also supposed to help with fine lines and wrinkles! i was very skeptical for sure, but i was also desperate, so i ordered them.

after one week of using this product, i noticed my pores were definitely not as noticeable and my acne was greatly improving! i was still thinking there's no way this product is this great! i also noticed that my skin looked brighter and healthier as well.

so, i was nearing the end of the jar, and i began to notice that my forehead lines were softening and my laugh lines were also not as noticeable as before. i was officially sold on this product! not only had it basically cleared up my skin (aside from a hormonal related pimple here and there near my cycle), but my skin also appeared so much more youthful!

i am so excited about this product and hope that everyone suffering from adult acne will give it a shot! i know everyone's skin is different, and what worked for me may not work for everyone. however, this product will help exfoliate and cleanse the dirt and grime away from your skin no matter what. so, it definitely won't hurt to try, and it's a great value as well. i am definitely singing the praises of my new found go-to product for acne and wrinkles!

this product may cause stinging when you first begin to use it, especially if you have never used glycolic acid products before. it wasn't that bad for me, and would only sting for a few seconds, so i didn't have any issues continuing to use the 20% strength. however, if you do have really sensitive skin, i suggest that you start with the 10 or 15% strength glycolic acid pads. glycolix makes those strengths as well. good luck!

bottom line: try these if you're looking for something to help rid you of stubborn adult acne, or if you're simply looking for something to help with anti-aging or to help with wrinkles that have already formed. this product really is great!",2015-06-12,5,5,A3R79D9SZA0QDU,B00080DK86

i waited to use this for two weeks before writing a review, but even in that short amount of time, it has already made a huge difference in my skin, which appears brighter and feels smoother.  i've also noticed a pretty dramatic difference in my fine lines and wrinkles, especially around the eye area.  my red acne marks are also slowly fading, and i'm not getting as many breakouts as i had been.

i've been alternating this with my retin-a cream at night, and use one pad on my face, neck, chest, and the back of my hands.

1122,"this is a unique anti-aging product. the contents in the bottle looks just like the picture. the colors are separated and don't blend when gently shaken. i am fascinated with the beautiful separation of colors. the directions say to massage 3 to 4 drops of the oil onto your face and neck. i have found that i have to add a little more than that because it absorbs pretty quickly and that amount wouldn't stretch to cover all the suggested areas. i have bee using about a third of the dropper. the oil has an almost earthy smell and reminds me of some of the essential oils that i use. the ingredients are listed on the bottom of the box, but the product sticker label was placed there and i haven't had any success removing it to read it. it doesn't leave my skin feeling oily which was something i was afraid of before using it. i follow up with my daily moisturizer and there has been no problems with that. i haven't noticed any fewer wrinkles, however, i have been using anti-aging skin care products for a few years now, so that doesn't surprise me. i haven't had any issues with skin sensitivity since using this oil either.",2018-03-12,4,5,AWXQORMZ3JY4P,B000J10II4
1123,"elemis pro-collagen marine oil is one of the nicest face oils ive tried.  unlike other brands, this emollient is quickly absorbed and doesnt leave an oily appearance like so many others do.  i use it instead of a moisturizer before applying make-up.  three drops is plentyone on my forehead and cheeks is enough to massage around my entire face.  it works best if i apply it to a slightly wet face.  the oil makes an excellent base for liquid make-up, and helps spread it more smoothly and evenly.  the end result is a natural look that i like very much.

ive been using facial oils ever since my skin started drying out around age 50.  they really work wonders.  elemis isn't the only brand ive tried or use, but its certainly one of the nicest if you can afford it.  ingredients are plant based, and the main ingredient is coco-caprylate, a skin conditioning agent derived from coconut oil.  its one reason why this oil provides such good hydration, spreadability and such a silky feel.  the extensive addition of other oils and seaweeds helps reduce wrinkles and fine lines.

just looking at friends in the same age bracket is proof that oils like this are really slowing down the age process for me.  its the only addition ive added to my beauty regimen, and im quite happy with results.  my skin tone is better and wrinkles are few.",2018-03-11,5,5,A3C2JQC6R2K52C,B000J10II4
1124,"i've been using this off and on for the past week and my skin just loves it.  i find it best used after my nightly shower.  it really gets absorbed and seems to lock in moisture. when i get up in morning my face looks smoother and more refreshed.  i also like that it isn't sticky or thick and seems to work with my skin unlike other oils which seem to clog my pores.  the marine oil has a faint herbal scent that is sort of more masculine opposed to a citrus or flowery scent which is not off putting and which i like.  i did try using it in the morning and let is soak in my face before using my bb cream.  but this was a bad combination.  the oil actually separated the bb cream and probably would do the same with any foundation or concealer you might use.  i think this is because although it is light there is still a oil barrier on the surface or you face that the make up does not mix well with.  so perhaps this oil does not completely absorb but locks in moisture, preventing it from leaving.  it might be a good idea to use my facial regime/ treatment such as cleaning, moisturizing and any serums first then at this oil last to lock everything in.",2018-03-05,5,3,A27D0VRNOOUNRR,B000J10II4

1130,"the description of elemis pro collagen serum really drew me in and i hoped that this product would be different from others i have tried.  there's nothing like promising a 40-something year old woman her fine lines will be reduced, but sadly i have not seen any change in my skin over the past month of using this product.

elemis serum has a rather strong, lingering, perfume scent.  it isn't a bad scent, it is just stronger and more noticeable than i am used to with face products.  the serum is quite thick and oily feeling.  applying it feels like rubbing coconut oil on my skin.  i have been using this at night, after washing my face, and then following it with my usual moisturizer as the directions indicate.  as oily as the serum feels, i have to say i don't wake up in the morning with a greasy face.  my skin has not broken out or seemed irritated by this product.  my fine lines and wrinkles have not changed in any way, however so unless i do notice a difference by the time this supply runs out, i will not plan on ordering more.",2017-09-19,3,3,A14E7LZASLSX36,B000J10II4
1131,"i found this product to be frustrating, not terrible but not worth the high price.

firstly it commits the packaging sin of having twice as much space in the box as the tiny little bottle takes up.  there is literally no reason for it to be in that size box, except to imply that the consumer is getting more product than they are actually getting.  dishonest.

it has a very strong, distinctive smell which i personally did not prefer for my face.  it lingers because the serum is an oil base, so you still get whiffs of the smell long after you've applied it.

it takes a while to sink in due to the oily nature of the product.  while i think this allows for a good concentration of the hyaluronic acid component, it's a little unpleasant if you accidentally touch your face before it's absorbed.

i strongly dislike this brand's lack of a transparent disclosure of ingredients.  i want to know exactly what i'm putting on my face.  this information is severely lacking - they say that it's hyaluronic acid and oil, but that's it.  i'm sure there are other additives.",2017-08-31,2,3,A2VHQDJBZH0Y7P,B000J10II4
1132,"a somewhat "perfumey" scented lotion type white balm in attractive packaging. it is supposed to help with anti aging of my neck area. first thing i have to say is that it could be a little more generously  portioned since it's for the entire neck area i need to use more of it than what i would normally disperse, for say, an eye cream. so seeing as how this product is only 1.6 oz i did not to get even a full month's use out of it when applying it everyday to the neck/throat area.

that being said i do like the fact that it contains so many natural ingredients: sea buckthorn, tree fern, mimosa flower extract, macadamia seed oil and padina pavonica among others. it feels good on my skin and i noticed no sensitivities to it even though i normally do have fairly sensitive skin and rosacea.

this balm immediately helped my skin feel hydrated and moisturized. it's a little too expensive for me to buy as a regular beauty item. at almost $80 a bottle i could not afford this regimen just to keep my neck looking younger. so unless you have a pretty thick budget then this really wouldn't be a practical product for you. four stars for a very luxurious product but minus a star for the exorbitant price and the fact that i didn't really see any results after using the entire bottle except for a smoother and  hydrated neck area.",2017-08-30,4,4,A2Z8B2KA8K07DM,B000J10II4

the directions say to keep this serum out of your eyes, so be careful about that. otherwise, just rub it into your face and neck.

i really like this product except for the smell. i'm awfully sensitive i should say, and the odor of this product really puts me off. for that reason, i won't be ordering more. and it's a shame because it really works. :(",2017-08-27,4,5,AL1708MTIB1MD,B000J10II4

as for this elemis pro-collagen neck & decollete balm, you need very little applied to the neck and upper chest area, and i find i get the best results if using their products at bed time. they claim you will see results in 1 month, but i never have. i've been using this for 3 weeks and so far no results, but i know i will see results in a couple months, as this is how elemis products work.

my skin feels tighter in this month, but the lines and wrinkles are still here. i know elemis products get rid of fine lines and wrinkles, but do nothing for the deeper ones. i have yet to find any products that can get rid of deep wrinkles, so i'm even happy to see the fine ones less noticeable. it's even nice to have smoother, tighter skin in 3 weeks, wrinkles and all.",2017-08-26,4,5,A19YOYY7FLQMA6,B000J10II4

her report: "this serum feels somewhat greasy going on, but once on the skin for a few minutes, feels refreshing and adds moisture. upon application, it leaves my skin feeling young and smooth. the elixir has a very appealing smell, light and slightly floral. after three weeks of use, my husband and i both agree this has reduced lines around the eyes and forehead somewhat, especially when the facial features are relaxed. i would say this is the best elixir i have tried."",2017-08-26,5,5,A35Y0RSU09ANEN,B000J10II4

1140,"this is not a lotion but an opaque oil.  it is heavily scented and goes on greasy.  i find that if i put it on early enough ahead of my makeup, i can go ahead and apply makeup over it, but immediately after application my face feels oily and not a good surface to apply makeup.  thankfully, the scent also fades, because it's really strong and would not only clash with my cologne but is overpowering so close to my nose. i love scented products but this one is a bit much even for me.  one pump is enough only for my face; if i want to include my neck and decollete i need two.

how does it work? my face feels moisturized and "plumper" after application. i don't think it does a whole lot to minimize the look of fine lines and wrinkles that are already there.  i have to trust that it's working in the long run, but short-term there's not a lot to go on.

i don't have many wrinkles aside from a few tiny ones at the corner of my eyes, but i didn't see any improvement in those. i didn't think my skin looked better or worse in general, except for the fact that using this serum made me break out in tiny pimples on my upper lip.

1186,"so i've tried probably hundreds of balms over the years and i truly think jack black balms are one of the best on the market. they are thin, but so, so emollient and last a long time on the lips. i've got very dry lips and generally need to apply balm many times throughout the day but with these i can go several hours between applications. i appreciate the more subdued scents; i love smelling berries and candy on my lips sometimes, but other times it's nice to have a more grown-up scent. for the price, you can't go wrong, this is a wonderful product that could be priced much higher and still be worth it.",2014-03-19,5,5,A32NZK5H2NIM13,B000MIH34Q
1187,"i have tried many different brands.  all the supermarket brands seem to just force me to become dependent on their product rather than actually moisturizing.  i feel those brands just create a momentary barrier, that still leads to my lips peeling.  i've tried kiehl's as well, which is better than store brands, but same dilemma.  this product is different.  first, it is not your typical tube "chapstick" type of product.  it is a squeezed balm that you apply with the plastic applicator tip.  second, i applied it about 3-4 times throughout the day, and by the next day, my lips were moisturized, and i didn't have any peeling.  good stuff, i will shell out the extra money to buy this stuff again.",2014-01-04,5,5,A382QYAWI6F811,B000MIH34Q
1188,"this is a good lip balm and it definitely moisturize your lips. you don't have to put much of it on your lips because if you do, it will cause your lips to have a lot of white stuff on them. the lip balm will last you for a while. the jack black lip balm is more expensive than most store bought brands but it is very effective and worth the money. i know longer use this lip balm because i now use karite lips lip balm with shea butter and vanilla. the jack black lip balm is definitely worth the try if you are looking to try a new lip balm and women can use it to if they want to.",2013-12-20,4,5,A1EIPS6D0ZZ4UA,B000MIH34Q
1189,"my lips get dry year-round so i have to use lip balm quite often.  over the years, ive tried everything from the mass brands (chapstick, vaseline, etc) to the high-end brands (burts bees, kiehls, every man jack, baxter, etc).  but ive found that nothing beats jack black for effectiveness.

as a male, i like that it provides moisture to my lips but doesnt make it look like im wearing lip gloss.  it also provides spf 25 coverage, which a lot of brands don't offer.

ive tried most of the scents theyve released.  a lot of them tend to be sweet, but stick to natural mint or shea butter for a neutral scent.  one great thing about the mint is that peppermint on your lips has been found to reduce hunger.  and ive actually found that to be the case for me.  so that scent might be good if you are on a diet.  another positive is that you can leave it in your car in hot weather, because it won't melt like a balm stick.

in terms of negatives- the price is high.  also, the paint they use on the tube logo isn't of high quality.  ive found that it flakes off onto your hands and clothes when you get close to the end.

overall though, this is my go-to lip balm.",2013-12-12,5,4,A3KDO3XV0MK1GX,B000MIH34Q

1196,"this lip balm is a bit pricey compared to your regular every day chapstick or blistex tubed lip balms, but it is very good lip balm and worth the price.

it heals and soothes chapped or dry lips quickly. moisturization lasts, so you don't have to apply it constantly. all 3 varieties are good, but i think this one is best for healing really chapped lips.

consistency isn't too thick or shiny. it won't make a man look like he is wearing lip gloss. i've been buying these for my son and husband for a few years now. they are always happy to receive them. it is a nice "manly" sophisticated looking tube.",2012-02-20,5,5,A1QBOC76MIOJYP,B000MIH34Q

1199,"there is a reason that most nail salons use opi polishes exclusively; these are definitely high quality products.  when i paint my nails with opi, i find that they look good with minimal touch-ups for a week or more.  i particularly like this shade, tutti frutti tonga, as it is a soft, wearable pink with a hint of frost.  although the shade is pale, it is not overly sheer, so 1-2 coats are all that is required.  definitely a must as a great everyday pink color for nails.",2007-04-25,5,5,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B000NG80GM
1200,"i've been doing my nails (not a salon, me), since i was a kid. i'm middle-aged now, and after trying all sorts of brands, from the cheap to the high-end pricey ones, i've concluded that opi is the best.

these polishes last two weeks, easy, looking decently on my toes. hands less long (cause i wash dishes without gloves).

lately, i've forgone nail polish on my fingers (laziness), but i still love to opi my toes.

opi goes on smooth, dries relatively fast, has rich colors, and lasts. chick flick cherry is my fave of the cool, darker reds. gorgeous red that makes my toes girly, sexy, and very happy. hubby loves this color, too. even comments on it. (when a man comments on a toenail color, it's gotta be nice!)

malaga wine is another lovely darker, coolor, winey-red color. (try kennebunk-port, too. niiiice.)  and in the warmer reds, thrill of brazil, smok'n in havana are tops. moscow red and big apple red are terrific medium reds. and the signature opi red is probably flattering on just about everybody, a clear, bright red edging into coolness, a crisp red.

other excellent colors to scope out: yucantan if you want, dutch tulips, silent mauvie, 20 candles on my cake.

opi also has lovely mauves, roses, and natural/beighey/caramel tones, but nothing beats their outstanding reds.

too many colors, too little pedicure time!

i strongly recommend the opi nail products. truly superior. your husband or boyfriend will be delighted.",2007-03-05,5,5,A1WX42M589VAMQ,B000NG80GM

1337,"i'm going to preface this and say to be cautious....make sure you're getting a legitimate real product, and not a fake. this stuff is amazing. one thing i've learned about mb products, is that you have to let go of your preconceived notions of words like "lotion." they're taking the pharmacological terminology here: "a liquid, usually aqueous or sometimes alcoholic preparation containing insoluble material in the form of a suspension or emulsion." mb "lotions" are often very thin liquid. this is no different. shake it up, and it's the consistency of skim milk. the sulfur is the main active ingredient here, and it works well, but is very drying. i have oily skin, not a huge issue for me, and i use it for spot treatment. i'm suffering an awful hormonal breakout of some deep cysts now, and i put this on last night. i'm not going to tell you they've miraculously disappeared overnight, but they are significantly better this morning! one that was smaller was very nearly gone this morning. i dab this stuff on with (clean) fingers. it dries on fast, so i pat it on until i see a thin hazy white patch over where i want it. i do this after all of my other skin care steps....just at the end, and leave it be overnight. it's been a lifesaver, in addition to their drying lotion. it's totally worth spending a couple of bucks on (even original price, to make sure you get a genuine product). it lasts a long time. i am not even half way through this bottle after a year and a half. keep in mind, this is one step, one tool, it's not going to create miracles if the rest of your skin care routine is crap.",2016-07-04,5,5,A1QYE76M7E4ZK4,B000O5RVJO

i use this product after i'm done washing and cleansing my face at night. i shake the bottle well and put a few drops on my face, concentrating on problem areas. my face feels very clean and i can feel the product working, without making it feel irritated or too dry. i have combo skin type and this seems to be effective in both areas. i feel like it greatly improves pimples overnight or within 1-2 days!

as a person who gets occasional cystic acne - something insanely huge and resistant to treatment - i can tell you i've tried it all - accutane, retin-a, acids, benzoyl peroxide, etc. even accutane, which clears while your using it and sometime after, didn't provide a permanent cure for my cystic acne. benzoyl peroxide can work but is very drying and additionally is responsible for countless bleached out spots on my pillow cases and face towels. i still use tca and lactic acid just dotted on the spots when things are really stubborn but this little solution is remarkable. most of the time dabbing this on a few times a day sends that cyst packing within two days.

it's expensive but last a long time. i don't think the delivery system is very efficient though. you definitely waste product dispensing it - there's no way around it and at that price it's annoying but nonetheless it's lasting quite sometime.",2016-05-06,5,5,A3POA5GUWACBD4,B000O5RVJO

1364,"i was hoping for a magic acne cure for my adult-onset severe cystic acid that i've been struggling with for over 6 months now. this hasn't cleared up my skin like i had hoped, but it does help a ton to reduce inflammation over night. would definitely recommend, in conjunction with other treatments.

pros:
1) quickly dries out cystic acne over night.
2) inexpensive compared to many other products i've tried (although the bottle doesn't last very long).
3) other products seem to work better when there are no inflamed blemishes to deal with.

cons:
1) hard to apply. i use a q-tip but inevitably some is wasted due to the watery nature of the product.
2) does dry out your skin quite a bit.
3) unclear how much it actually "heals" blemishes. while they are reduced in the short term, it does seem like they come back.

i'd also recommend trying out the 20% salicylic acid peel from perfect image and the mario badescu glycolic acid toner. acne-hell has basically reduced my skincare routine to slathering my face with various types of acid...but i've finally started to get traction against it.

after the cleanser is removed, the first few times i felt a sting, perhaps because my face was finally clean.  initially i had a breakout and considered stopping use, but again i think this was my skin adjusting to being clean because it went away in about a week and did not come back, even during that awful pms time.

i was actually not as concerned about breakouts as i was that my face was starting to look dull, tired and worn out.  i work a lot, and get little sleep - which is no good.  but once i started catching up on sleep i thought my face still looked dull and colorless.  i tried this cleanser to brighten my face.  i was not disappointed.  i think i'm looking brighter, more my age or perhaps a year or two younger.

1423,"i love opi's nail envy and have used it for several years.  so, why am i giving it 1-star?  because it's hit-or-miss whether you'll get the same stuff each time you order this particular product.

the first time i bought it was from a salon and i was a fan from the start.  for the first time ever, i finally found a nail strengthener that really works for me and, best of all, stays on!  i simply apply two coats of the nail envy, follow that with 1-2 coats of my nail laquer color of choice, and then top it with either a second coat of clear nail envy or opi top coat.  it makes my nails stronger and longer then they've ever been, plus i can count on it to stay for 6-8 days before needing to strip off the layers and start over.

i've successfully ordered this from amazon with positive results.  but, unfortunately, that's not always the case lately.  sometimes it's a close match but just different enough in its performance that i question it.  my latest order gives me no doubt, though, despite arriving in its usual original-looking box/wrapping.  counterfeit or a major change in opi's formula, who knows?  but it's awful.  it doesn't stay on well at all and yellows horribly.

1461,"ok, so i've been using this product for exactly a month now.  i wasn't sure of it at first, but i read a review that said to stick with it at least a month, and i'm so glad i did.

as a little bit of history, my nails haven't been able to grow long nails in the last 4 years - starting when i was pregnant with my son.  my nails prior to that would grow relatively ok - they would still chip a bit.  but in the last 4 years, my nails have been so brittle and pealed so badly that i couldn't grow them past little stubs.  it has been frustrating to say the least. i tried different nail polishes. different top coats. shillac nails.  everything i could think of.

one day, about a month ago, i got on amazon and typed in nail strengthener.  this little gem popped up. i was pleased with the price and read through the reviews and tips.

do, as other reviewers stated, read the instructions and apply it as instructed.  in fact, apply it more liberally if you have really bad nails like me.  i put on a new coat every other day.  sometimes i leave a coat on over a week since it still looks good and thick.  also, feel free to apply extra in between if you chip a nail or some of the polish wears down or comes off!  it'll help your bad nails continue to grow.  if i feel the tips starting to wear down, i'll liberally put on extra.  also, i don't recommend taking the polish off your nails and then taking a shower (running a finger through your hair) as your nails won't magically get better underneath (not that i've seen yet). make sure you remove and reapply in the same setting.

do clean and cut your cuticles.  i didn't at first, and the polish stuck to my cuticles dragging them along for the ride.

do buy something to dig the dirt out under your nails. i find, now that i have nails, they can get a little dirty.

do give it at least a month for fabulous results.  in a month, as i'm typing this, i have a full set of hard, beautiful nails on both hands!  this is the first time in years!!!

do use this product consistently and liberally.

do buy this from amazon.com.  i saw this for almost twice the price at a local pharmaceutical store.

do let this product completely dry before touching something.  it takes a long time... a really, really long time to dry.  and if you smudge it on something, just reapply extra.  it'll harden and cover up the flaw (usually).

do not wear nail polish with it... but with gorgeous nails like this, you'll be ok with the trade off.

do try it!!!!  i'm completely impressed. i have the bottle sitting right in front of me at work, and i'm debating buying a bottle for work and for home - for those little times my nails mess up and i need to save them.  i can't believe how gorgeous my nails are.",2014-06-19,5,5,A1A8RXQ55UA8XH,B000PZA2KS

1471,"i bought this because i have very weak nails.  i mean they can bend backwards and forwards with no issue whatsoever.  i had originally seen this item on pinterest and looked more into it on amazon.  i read all of the review prior to buying and made the decision to buy this matte version over the original as i don't care for my nails to be too shiny.  i've also never been one to wear nail polish on my fingernails.  i purchased this product a little over a month ago.  it arrived well packaged and in a timely fashion.  i followed the instructions to a t.  first night, 2 coats and then 1 coat every other evening.  i found it dried rather quickly and because it was clear, i didn't feel the need to hold up my hands away from away from everything for fear of smudges.  within a week, my nails were already looking and feeling better.  they didn't bend forward nearly as easily as prior to using and there was no way i could bend them backwards.  the tips of my fingernails though were weird.  at first, the whiteness started to disappear and then a few days later came back whiter than ever.  not sure why, but i'm not complaining as my co-worker actually asked me the other day where i got my acrylics done.  so, this product worked quite well for me and i am a lifetime user.

now, the reason i give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because you basically have to use it forever for your nails to stay hard.  i decided after about 3 1/2  weeks of using this as directed to see what would happen if i stopped.  well, my nails grew as to be expected, but the hardness of them was gone.  they pretty much went right back to the way before i started using this product.  so, while it worked for me as stated, i will have to use it forever.",2013-04-05,4,4,A3DIJAXX4S4C49,B000PZA2KS

1478,"for some strange reason, the only time i care about my nails looking extra good is for my trip to las vegas each year. i mean - i care the rest of the year how they appear - i certainly don't want everyone to see straggly-looking nails, but as long as they look reasonably good, i'm happy with just using clear nail polish applied once a week and that's it.

i had tried other nail strengtheners in the past -- cheap products such as sally hansen -- and pricier products such as tips and prostrong. none of these worked as well as the opi nail envy.

nail envy comes in a matte finish or natural finish (clear and shiny). i like the matte as it looks more natural.  the natural finish is glossy and looks like a layer of glass on your nails.

even though it is fairly thick when applied, it dries quickly.  nail envy can be used as a base, a top coat or as a nail strengthener. however, if used as a nail strengthener, which i might say is the best product i've used, the results are not cumulative. once you quit using it, your nails go back to the original brittle condition.

when used for strengthening, you must of course start out with clean dry nails. two coats are required to start, and then every other day another coat is applied. at the end of the week you remove the nail envy and start over with the same routine. opi "recommends" a non-acetone based polish remover, but i didn't have that type on hand so i used my regular acetone remover and it worked just as well. it doesn't require a lot of effort to obtain good results with this product.",2010-04-10,5,5,A3CG93783LP0FO,B000PZA2KS

1489,"vichy puret&eacute; thermale 3-in-1 micellar water is formulated to cleanse, remove makeup and calm skin irritation in one easy step that just requires pouring it on a cotton pad or cotton ball and wiping the eye area and face. no rinsing is required. i like that this product contains no soap, colorants, oil or alcohol, but i do wish it was free of chemical fragrance too (though at least the scent is light).

this is the best micellar water i've tried for removing my face makeup (though it's not great for my eyes). i don't wear heavy makeup but do wear mascara, concealer, foundation and powdered bronzer, contour makeup and/or blush. my cotton pad is covered with makeup after wiping my face, and i've used my clarisonic after and don't see residual makeup on the brush.

i still usually prefer to also use my regular cleanser, but this micellar water does the trick when i'm tired at night as i just wipe my face it and let it air dry while i brush my teeth (and just follow with my serum and cream). my skin is dry and sensitive, and it feels clean and comfortable even without rinsing and doesn't feel dry or irritated from the micellar water. it does feel just a bit tacky without rinsing, but that feeling goes away as soon as i apply my regular serum and cream.

i like this micellar water for my face, but it doesn't work well very for removing my lancme mascara (which is not waterproof). it stings my eyes and gently wiping doesn't get rid of enough of my mascara. i get much better results using lancme bifacil eye makeup remover and it has never irritated my eyes. so i use the vichy micellar water for my face makeup and the lancme for my eye makeup. i think the vichy micellar water is a good product, but i'm taking one star off because it's not good for removing my mascara. 4 stars.

8/31/2017: my commute and work days have been really long lately, and the weather has been so hot. i come home beat and one of the first things i do is wipe my face with this vichy micellar water. while it's not perfect, i've grown to love its convenience and how it's refreshing and removes so much makeup and grime without drying my skin out, i'm upgrading my rating from 4 to 5 stars.",2017-07-30,5,4,A2L6BT1PVV9YN0,B000Q388UK
1490,"i've been using micellar water for some time now to clean my face at the end of the day.  that's why i was happy to test out this vichy product, since it's a brand i haven't used before.  i can say that the small bottle is pretty.  prettier than the bottle my garnier micellar water comes in.  so this wins in presentation.

unfortunately, that's the only category this vichy micellar water wins in my estimation.  the garnier brand leaves my face feeling much cleaner and smoother than the vichy, while the vichy feels a bit soapy when wet on my face, takes longer to dry, and leaves my face feeling much drier than the garnier does.  the garnier has no oil, alcohol, or fragrance.  the vichy has hexylene glycol, panthenol and parfum.  the garnier comes in a 13.5 ounce bottle and costs about a dollar or more less than the 3.38 ounce bottle of vichy.  both garnier and vichy remove the small amount of make-up i use with no problem so there's a tie there.

so, no thanks.  i won't be buying this vichy micellar water again when this bottle is empty.  my sister who is visiting me also tried it a few times and said it left her face feeling sticky and not refreshed.  if a product does not perform well and costs much more than a competing brand, it's obvious which one i will continue to use in the future.",2017-07-29,3,3,AUZ3EJAU37NC5,B000Q388UK

after use, i notice that my skin feels like it does when i first wake up- a bit naturally oily.  i thought it might be makeup residue so i've tried it when i have absolutely no make up on, and it feels the same.  i think it is the glycerin in the product.  my skin is dry though, so it has worked ok for me.

to me the only downside is that it can come out too fast when i am not careful, causing waste.  occasionally too, not always, but sometimes, it can leave the skin around my t-zone feeling a bit sticky.  that area of my skin is naturally oilier, so i would think that people with oily skin might want to try to get a sample of this product if possible before investing in it.  it seems wonderful on my skin when it is dry and in need of moisture though.",2017-07-28,4,5,A2R1HUYHXV7H18,B000Q388UK

1500,"i always stocked up on micellar water products when i went to france - they've used it & loved it for years.  it was supposedly invented for parisian women because the water in paris is so "hard".  the water is hard there, i can vouch for that & that is why the pharmacy was always one of my first stops when arriving in paris.  hard water makes it difficult to remove all your makeup & tends to dry out the skin.  also, micellar water is wonderful for cleaning your skin even if you are not wearing makeup.

this is really good micellar water.  it barely has a scent & does not irritate my skin or around my eyes.  i use this water on a cotton pad to remove eye makeup and foundation.  i even use it to cleanse my skin when i do not wear makeup.  just squeeze the water on to a disposable cotton pad, hold over your eye for about 15 seconds, then gently wipe away the makeup.  you will probably need more than one pad to clean your face.  i like "swisspers" brand cotton rounds - you can buy them on amazon or at costco, etc.

this stuff is not magic, it's science & it's been around for a long time.  the micelle surfactant molecule is suspended in liquid/water and kind of grabs on to the dirt/oils/makeup on your face & doesn't allow it to stick on your face.  (that is my simple, non-scientist explanation.)  there is no irritation - even around eyes.  and the skin actually feels clean without rinsing with tap water - really!  when you use it, it seems like you are just using regular tap water except it actually dissolves/grabs the goo/makeup/dirt off your face.",2017-05-18,5,3,AW6J9IILGOZY3,B000Q388UK

with that being said, it is very friendly to sensitive skin. this is also alcohol free, so i didn't feel any drying effect that would typically occur with some of the other toners that i've used in the past. the only thing is that this product did leave my skin with a tacky feeling immediately afterwards. i didn't wash it off to see if the feeling would disappear. it took about a half hour, but the sticky, tackiness did eventually fade. i also didn't need to apply additional moisturizer or anything, thereafter. a huge plus is that this paraben free, which always gets a star in my book. the fragrance is one of my favorite aspects, because it reminds me a lot of rose water, which i love.  all in all, it's a decent product for convenient facial washing and toner. i do like how well it removes my makeup. i just have to remember to keep my eyes shut extremely tight during use.",2017-05-11,3,5,AZQKNX6F8S84Q,B000Q388UK

i apply this cleanser using flat cotton rounds.  that way, i can minimize the fibers on my face and around my eyes.  i don't have to rub -- the dirt comes right off with a swipe.  this is soooo much better than the l'oreal micellar water cleanser i've used in the past.

it also works well enough if:

1. you don't prefer a cleanser used with water. i do, unfortunately.

2. you like this type of pump bottle. it's more convenient than unscrewing and re-screwing a bottle. but the size doesn't work for me. not liking counter clutter, i keep such items in the medicine chest, and this is too tall.",2016-10-29,4,3,A30ODR6WBE61UB,B000Q388UK

i've been using using it every night to remove makeup and dirt and my skin has never felt better. apparently the hype was true! despite having very sensitive skin, this product is gentle yet cleansing and tones perfectly. truly amazing and i would highly recommend.",2016-10-28,5,5,A11F5KW6QXHL8L,B000Q388UK
1529,"i am not sure how to write this review since i really like the product even if it is not the answer to all my makeup removing needs.
this is a lightweight liquid that is applied using a cotton pad and as stated, no rinsing is necessary. in that sense it works like a toner and leaves your skin feeling soft, clean and fresh. i love using it for that reason alone.
as for removing makeup, it is not as effective as i had hoped. too much product  is needed to remove my average workday makeup - using my normal remover with water is easier, faster and more thorough. but using this after my usual remover is wonderful and definitely a nice last step to add to my cleansing routine. on days when i do not wear makeup, this is perfect for keeping my skin looking and feeling clean, such as after a workout or a day spent outdoors.
at 13.5 oz, this bottle is 1 1/2-2 times larger than other comparable products so the price per ounce is not unreasonable.

1530,"the vichy purete thermale 3-in-1 calming cleanser is a nice toner for skin, but not a particularly great make up remover.  i test this cleanser on both unwashed and washed skin, as well as pre and post make up removal.  the cleaner worked well to catch any residual makeup i missed after a makeup removal and washing with my normal remover and cleanser.  while it did work adequately on its own to cleanse skin and remove a light layer of foundation, it wasn't as effective when removing eye make up.  it took a lot of scrubbing to remove everything when used alone.

as a toner (used after washing my face), this works very well, and didn't agitate or cause my skin to break out.  what i liked about this as a toner is that it didn't make my skin feel tight and dried out, but instead felt a little tingly and made my skin feel very clean.  i really enjoyed this clean feeling, and for that, it's worth trying out.  i'm not totally sold on purchasing this in the future - there are other products that are comparable in effectiveness and price, and while it works well as a toner, i expected more of it since it's touted as a 3-in-1 one step product.  while this didn't work perfectly for me, it may be great for someone else, and is worth a try.",2016-10-25,4,5,A3U029B8Z5WGI2,B000Q388UK

i am thrilled that this is also a toner since those can be so very drying on my skin.  this reduces several steps in my skin care routine which is wonderful.  my pores look a lot better.  one thing:  it doesn't really do well removing waterproof mascara, so i recommend using remover specifically for that.  this is my new favorite thing!",2016-10-20,5,5,A2TBZAC0XYHLIB,B000Q388UK

subjective reaction based on my experience -- i like the product but i also do not wear a lot of make-up so my main concern was not in removing water-proof mascara or other tough to remove substances. i was looking for a good cleanser to help moisturize rather than strip my skin of oil. when i do need a make-up remover, i use wipes designed for that job.

for your face, you wet your skin, squirt some into your hand, and massage it on your face.  it will start to lather a little bit.  then, you can either use a scrubbing device, or wash it off with a washcloth.  i personally think that you need to use a scrubbing device, like&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/prox-by-olay-advanced-cleansing-system-with-facial-brush/dp/b0043oyfku/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8">prox by olay advanced cleansing system with facial brush</a>&nbsp;to remove my makeup.  it is much more effective in getting it all off, then just using a cloth.

original review:
i have waited for my wife to put on make-up so she could use this product to remove it.  yesterday she sat at her make-up station and tried out several of her new eye applications (different bases and one with glitter that she's used before) and said for me to give this full marks.  she was very pleased with the efficient way it took off the make-up and cleaned her face (multiple times) and was pleased that she did not need to rinse afterward.  today she says she felt no discomfort with her face and she is totally pleased with it and will buy this brand from now on.

side note:  she does have problems with facial blemishes from time to time, so i will report that if she feels it is the fault of this product, but as of now she says she is not worried that could happen.",2015-11-18,5,5,A2OR94VN7XQCUO,B000Q388UK

my teenage daughter has tried several micellar cleansers, lately, and this was one of them. so far, they all seem to be pretty much the same in terms of effectiveness, which leads me to believe there is little difference in these products aside from the cost. so, as you shop around, you're probably fine in choosing a cheaper option than this particular product. this is a great product, mind you, but the price is definitely higher than some of the other options that are available. i still give it four stars, though, because it has been a very effective product.",2015-11-08,4,4,A1LG1DKUZXGJ6J,B000Q388UK

she saturates a cotton pad and gently removes all makeup from her face, quickly and easily with no mess and no repeated application.  even waterproof eyeliner is easily removed and with no stinging or other discomfort.  she uses it all over her face and neck and does not need to use any soap or other cleanser when finished.

after application, she says her skin feels very soft. this is undoubtedly due to the tiny molecules of oil suspended in the vichy cleanser which prevent the skin from feeling completely stripped of natural moisture.  when blended with the skin's own oils, these molecules encourage the skin to replenish its own natural levels of moisture so that the skin's natural process isn't interrupted due to over-cleansing.

i like this product.  it removes makeup like it says.  i also like that there is no sting like you get from many toners.  it leaves you with just a fresh feeling.

that said, i'm having to pass this on to my teen daughter because a) i find it irritates my skin, and b) my daughter wears a lot more eye makeup than i do.

as far as the irritation, i have a lot of allergies and super sensitive old-mom skin and what i found is that this left my skin 'burning'.  i rinsed my face with water but the feeling persisted.  i doubt many people will be effected by this but wanted to give other moms with dry, sensitive skin a heads up.

the other thing i want to note is that i felt like i needed to rinse my face after using this product because if felt very slightly sticky/filmy.

cleansing with an oil based product was a big stretch for me. i had tried argon oil and was really never pleased with the results. however, i tried this and much to my surprise was very pleased.

i followed the directions, applied with my fingers directly to my dry face and eye area using a circular motion.  then, i wet my hands and continued to massage my face, creating a milky emulsion. rinsed off with water. my skin felt smooth, and according to the info, the camellia oil  does moisturize and soften my skin. during the day i do not wear much make up,but this did remove my eye make up and cheek blush without much effort. my skin did not feel tight or stretched. this cleanser seems to have been tested for all skin types and sensitivities. there is a very light scent.

it's similar to the bareminerals mineralixirs facial cleansing oil i've been using. it feels wonderful on my mature skin, and when you add water it emulsifies and rinses off beautifully.  since i always remove my eye makeup first with my favorite (clinique rinse-off eye makeup solvent) i have no issue with whether this product can do that.  the scent is heavenly and not overbearing.  the pump dispenses a perfect amount2 pumps is perfect for me.  i think it's reasonably priced and recommend.",2015-10-29,4,5,A3I5YPJZMTG1QO,B000Q388UK

this particular oil's first ingredient is mineral oil- sounds scary? baby oil is pure mineral oil and it does good job in removing make up too. than some dissolvents, emollients and finally camellia seed oil and vitamin e.

performance:
it does remove make up well, but not 100% from eyes. i still use eye make up remover on reusable cotton pads. it didn't dried my skin and makes pore look very small (most oils do;jojoba, castor, maracuja etc).

this product does do a good job as far as a cleansing water and toner.  i put a little onto a cotton round and wiped it all over my face and neck, then repeated it with another cotton round. it left my skin feeling clean and refreshed, soft and not over dry.

1579,"i have started seeing micellar water pop into the market including at the high end makeup shops.

i read online that micellar is somewhere between a toner and a cleanser.  it should remove makeup (waterproof formulas too) dirt and oil from the skin without stripping your completion.

according to dermatologist dr. macrene alexiades-armenakas, it all comes down to little molecules called micelles. "micelles are nano-sized, single-layer fatty bubbles," explained dr. alexiades-armenakas. "they are able to absorb other fats such as sebum and oils inside." consider: though olive oil and balsamic vinegar separate from each other, two oils would blend together. so, by using a lipid to cleanse your skin, the oils on the surface join up and leave you squeaky-clean. (popbeauty sugar)

so this lists that it is: soap-free. alcohol-free. colorant-free. ph-balanced. allergy-tested. non-comedogenic. suitable for sensitive skin. safe for contact lens wearers.

so what did i think?
i do not have waterproof makeup but i thought it took off my mascara decently. i would go over my eyes one more time with my eye makeup remover.  i also felt like it made my eye lids stick (i could feel it when i blinked) .  i don't have anything negative about it that i noticed after trying it for a week.  i used it with a round makeup wipe and i defiantly would see lots of makeup on it.  i would use this as an after facewash / after shower type cleanser / toner and not as my face wash alone.",2015-10-24,4,3,A3TMBYDFP1B9DM,B000Q388UK
1580,"when i took my acne prone teenage daughter to the dermatologist, he explained how even oily skin (especially) needed to use a moisturizer. in teens, the body goes into overdrive producing oil when the skin is too dry. she started using an oil cleaner and never had a bad acne breakout again. hydrated skin does not need to produce more oil, simple.
i have been using one brand or another ever since i saw it work so well on my daughter. you absolutely can use coconut or olive oil but you will be left with that oily coat on your skin. this beauty oil is formulated to foam with water and that is what washes the oil from your skin. i'm not sure which ingredient it is, the label is very tiny.
to use, take one or two drops of the thermale beauty cleanser and massage in in, i even used it on my eyes to remove mascara. it totally dissolved all make up and dirt! after you're done, add a few drops of water to your hands and massage it intot he oil on your skin. it emulsifies and gets creamy, the final step in removing the oil from your face. i suggest you wipe off with a washcloth and not too much water.
it left my skin so soft, no residue, no dryness at all. it has a slight scent but nothing too heavy.

1582,"vichy's micellar oil reminds me of a product i used to adore, babor's hy oil cleanser. unlike that cleanser, this is a "one part only" not requiring any mixing of 2 products. the cleansing power of micellar oil is superb, it attracts oily grime and makeup and gives my pores a lovely deep cleansing. i was concerned that my skin would feel "too clean", but that's not the case at all. yet my skin is every bit as clean as it would be with a lathering cleanser only my face doesn't feel tight and dry. i got the best results with 2 cleanses with this oil. i get super dirty at work, and one cleanse just isn't enough! this product is awesome for removing eye makeup as well. it takes a bit of getting used to using a product like this if you've been using lathering cleanser. those who use creamy cleansers will adapt much easier. if the skin still feels oily after using, you haven't rinsed enough! try it in the shower, and you'll see the difference.

i also recommend using a cleansing brush with this product (either manual or battery operated like a clairsonic), this really helps clean pores in the t zone where blackheads can accumulate. vichy offers several different versions of this product for all different types of skin types; oily, combination, and this one for normal to dry. this version is intended for dry skin, and shouldn't be used by younger/oilier complexions. i plan to continue using the vichy micellar oil from now on, i've been "converted"! i'm looking forward to using this as the weather changes to winter, and my skin gets extremely parched by indoor heat. highly recommended!",2015-10-20,5,5,A2GA64WZK8PKBC,B000Q388UK
1583,"cleaning your face with oil makes a lot of sense: instead of using detergents and stripping your skin's protective mantle, oil dissolves the makeup and other crud on your face. for the last few years, beauty websites have been promoting the virtues of washing your face with coconut, argan, or olive oil. micellar cleansers are the next-touted version to emerge, composed of micelles, or tiny oil molecules in a water suspension. ("micelle" sounds way more impressive than just plain oil & water.) because your skin isn't being deprived of the beneficial oils along with the unwanted makeup and sunscreen, it will feel not only clean but smooth after a wash. oil cleansing is ideal for all kinds of skin, including blemished complexions: it may seem intuitively wrong to add oil to oily skin, but magically, it works, and unclogs the pores rather than creating more problems.

how effective is this vichy cleanser? the first night i tried it, i had a temporary tattoo on my face, which i tried to scrub off with my usual non-oil facial cleanser in the shower. i got maybe half of it. applied the vichy, a little water, massaged it for a few seconds, and all traces of tattoo were zapped.

the vichy uses camellia oil, which i don't like quite as much as the argan, but it's a lot less expensive. plus the bottle has french writing all over it. a cosmopolitan addition to the medicine cabinet! i had been searching for a reasonably priced oil cleanser and was thrilled when this popped up in my vine queue. the bottle is huge and will probably last a year, even with daily use. good value, and a product that delivers.",2015-10-18,5,3,AR9GZ8B7NJJPN,B000Q388UK
1584,"unlike most of my facial cleansers, this one is an oil.  and i knew that when i chose it because i wanted to use my soft electric brushead to see if it would really clean out my impurities.  i have sorta large pores and usually whiteheads high on my cheek bones. and i wanted to see what would happen to my face if i used an oil.

well, nothing happened....yet.  i am sure i have to use it a longer time than i have.  my skin does feel clean and soft but it did before  this.  i don't see much difference yet in  the whiteheads or large pores.  i shall continue to use it and if  a eureka  occurs i shall make an addiion to this review.
the oil actually seems to come off your skins with rinsing but i need more time to give this a true test.  by the way, it is my understanding that the natural minerals and the antioxidants comes directly from vichy thermal spa .

1591,"i got this mostly as a facial cleanser and not for removal of makeup, so i can't tell you if it's good at removing makeup.  perhaps their 3-in-1 is overkill for me because of that, but i will say that i like it overall as a facial cleanser.  it's got a great scent to it, and i think that it has a good viscosity (not thick at all, but also not so watery as to run off of your fingers or cotton pad before applying).

this is really easy to apply.  i didn't have cotton pads when i first got it and thought that it was a little awkward to use, but then i got some pads and find it much easier.

the scent is both subtle and pleasant (to me).  it has no overpowering perfume to it like some facial cleansers.  in short - it's just nice.

it also leaves my face feeling smooth.  some reviewers have noted that it dries their skin, but i've been fortunate and haven't had that happen.  my face feels more moisturized afterwards.

my first thought regarding the price was, "wow, this is expensive."  then i started thinking about how much i pay for other facial cleaners and moisturizers.  these are actually pretty large dispensers at 6.7-ounces, at least compared to a lot of other products.  i was going to say how expensive these are, but the more that i thought about it, i really don't think they are.

i'm not sure that i'd order it again, but i'm glad that i tried it.  it's a nice product, at least for cleaning my face and leaving it feeling moisturized.  some reviewers have noted that they don't think it's good for removing makeup, but i can't speak to that.",2017-08-27,4,5,A1J5HIF41ENSMZ,B000V3ME6Y

i really love that there is no soap in this product.  it cleans without lather and without drying your skin.  it contains the special volcanic water that vichy has made a cornerstone of their products and it's very gentle on your skin while removing makeup and other impurities without fuss.  i use some seriously persistent mascara and this product does leave a few traces of it behind if i'm not careful, but it otherwise cleans amazingly well and dissolves "water proof" mascara and eyeliner without a fuss.  it doesn't sting if you get it in your eyes and it doesn't cause any redness, chafing or stinging to your skin.  there's nothing harsh or even chemical about it.  it's very gentle and effective.  my skin is very sensitive these days and it acts as a soothing balm, even as it cleans.

1608,"i love all the vichy products i have tried, and this one is almost as good. i love the light, clean, feminine scent! this cleanser/toner/eye makeup remover is very gentle, even for my sensitive skin. although  i got some of the product in my eyes when i used it to to remove stubborn eye makeup, it did not irritate at all. i found that to be, not only surprising, but also a huge plus. best of all, it did not dry out my skin at all. it left it feeling soothed, clean, and refreshed. i felt no greasiness or dryness whatsoever.

sadly, i found that it was not very effective in removing all of the makeup. some of my mascara remained, even after vigorous scrubbing. also, i tested how well it cleaned my skin. i saturated a cotton ball with a toner, and found that this cleanser left some makeup and impurities behind.

unfortunately, it is way to greasy and after using it i had the urge to wash my face.  while i could see it being clean, it felt too heavy and greasy to just go to sleep like that.

i feel it defeated the purpose of having the toner because i have to wash it away and then apply toner.

it did not irritate the skin but i feel if used long term, this would lead to clogged pores and break outs (specially if you are acne prone).

[old review:
i used to have normal/ combination skin which has become drier over time. therefore, i've progressed to gentler products to wash my face, and have moved to cream-based cleansers for the most part, but which still require water to finish. this product is extremely smooth in texture, is not runny, but not solid- more like a light lotion, and it has a somewhat strong (i could still smell it on my face after it dried), but not unpleasant floral fragrance. the front of the tube says it is a "one step cleanser sensitive skin 1. cleaning milk 2. toner, 3. eye make-up remover." i put this on my unwashed made-up face at the end of the day, as the directions say you can do, and it did glide on very easily. i wiped it off with a pad, and it removed my eye makeup with no problem, and most of my foundation looked to be removed as well. my face felt very moist and soft (not oily), and it dried to "normal" skin texture after about two minutes.

after about ten minutes, my face felt a bit sensitive- stinging a bit, and i could still smell the product, so i rinsed my face well with water.

update- maybe 1/2 hr later: this maybe an outlier issue, but my face feels warm and red, and now also a bit tingly (not in a good way). i'm going to wash this off with soap, as i guess i'm one of the few that might be having a bad reaction to the cream.

i went to bed with my skin feeling refreshed but woke up with a reddish rash on my face. it didn't look good and it didn't feel very good. i washed my face with soap for sensitive skin and water. i didn't put anything else on it, hoping not to irritate my skin any further. i read the label closely and found perfume among the listed ingredients. i avoid preparations that include perfume because of my sensitive skin. this cleanser presents itself as formulated for sensitive skin but it contains the very ingredient i want to avoid.

the package directions say to remove the cleanser with cotton pads, but the product info on amazon says that you can also use water to wash it off. i use water, but that's just my personal preference.

1636,"i got this to review through the amazon vine program.  i am always on the lookout for a great cleanser for sensitive skin.  this product worked great on my skin and did not cause any breakouts and/or rashes... however, it did not do that great of a job as a cleanser and didn't work well at removing my makeup.

i have been using this cleanser for a few weeks now.  i have used it a couple of different ways.  first i used it in the shower as a cleanser to remove my makeup.  second i used it as a toner by putting some on a cotton pad and wiping my face with it before applying makeup.  the directions aren't completely clear on which is the best way to use it; it sounds like it's meant to be a general cleanser/toner.

i had issues with using it as a toner and then putting my makeup on over it.  my skin gets fairly greasy and this was just too heavy of a toner to leave on (or even put on and wipe clean with a cotton ball).  having it on under my make up caused my make up to rub off easily and my skin to look very greasy.  it's not a super heavy moisturizer, but it was heavy enough that i can't wear it under make up.

i liked using it as a cleanser better.  it goes on very smooth and washes off nicely (no filmy feeling on your skin).  you can get it in your eyes without any stinging, which is nice for those with sensitive eyes.  however, my issue with this sort of use was that it didn't do a good job washing off my makeup...especially my eye makeup.  i ended up having to either wash with this 3 or 4 times or use my acure facial scrub followed with this cleanser to actually get my foundation off.  eye makeup was just a no go; this did not remove eye makeup at all.

i do like that fact that it didn't cause my skin to break out.  i also like the fact that my eyes don't sting when it gets into them.  however, it didn't do a lot for me as far as removing makeup and/or toning.  in the end although it didn't cause me issues it didn't really go a good job cleansing either.  i probably won't repurchase.

pros:
- you get a lot of product for your money
- great for sensitive skin
- doesn't make eyes sting when you get it in them
- washes off nicely and easily

cons:
- doesn't remove foundation very well (takes multiple washes)
- absolutely does not remove eye makeup
- too heavy to use under makeup as a toner",2016-02-17,4,4,A22B13EJTZKCTM,B000V3ME6Y

i don't wear makeup other than lip gloss, lip treatment, or lipstick, products like that, so i can't really speak about how well this product removes makeup.

 for some reason this product leaves my face red, even tho it says it's suitable for sensitive skin.  i only use bamboo wash cloths to wash my face, which are very gentle.  it's not like iam scrubbing my face either, or using so much product that it is hard to get it off of my face.

the scent to me is just ok. i prefer the scents of the two other vichy products that i have more than i do this product.  the scent isn't bad, it's just not my favorite.

when i come home from work, i still use an oil cleanser (clinique's take the day off) as a first step, but then i use this as a second cleanser, and it seems to remove any last vestiges of makeup.  your skin actually feels soothed and moisturized, rather than tight.

1660,"i've been using this twice a day for a few weeks now. i'm not sure that it's a good product for me, though it may work for some. for what it's worth, it *is* non-drying.

one issue i had right away was that this left a residue on my skin after i rinsed my skin. when i looked at the ingredients list, i was surprised to see mineral oil as the second ingredient. i expect that made a large contribution to the oiliness. (for what it's worth, a quick swipe with toner got rid of the residue. and i would have used toner anyway.) i am impressed that this has a smooth and even consistency considering that the first two ingredients are water and mineral oil, which don't mix under ordinary circumstances. but this never separated at all.

this smells nice and has mostly been non-irritating, though i do think it is at least partially responsible for a recent breakout (i often have breakouts when i use oil-based cleansers). so if you are acne-prone (especially cystic acne), you will probably want to avoid this.

this claims to also be a toner, but i don't think that claim really holds up. the only way i can see calling it that is if you really want to minimize the number of products you use on your skin in a day. i would say this does better than my normal water-based cleanser at removing liquid foundation; it doesn't get 100% but it gets a lot. also, i did try this as an eye makeup remover and found it to be gentle and effective -- i put a little on a cotton ball and was able to remove eyeshadow, primer, and waterproof mascara, and all without rubbing too hard. it also did not irritate my eyes.

so, i like this as an eye makeup remover. it's effective as a cleanser but not really compatible with my skin. if you area fan of oil-based cleansers, you might be happy with this one.",2015-01-30,3,4,A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,B000V3ME6Y

1668,"i use this as a makeup remover and for that purpose, it's not bad. i find that i do have to use quite a few cotton balls in order to remove my face makeup, but it does the job - it quickly breaks up the products, and it feels like it soothes the skin as it's taking all of that gunk off. it's less effective when it comes to removing eye makeup: it always leaves mascara and eyeliner residue behind. however, it does remove a decent amount of those things and it doesn't irritate my eyes.

the fragrance is very light and pleasant, and i've got to say that this is one of the very, very few products that doesn't make me break out. however, i've found that if i try to leave it on my skin and let it air dry, my face starts to feel a little unclean and a little greasy. so i've learned that i have to go back in with a mild cleanser to remove this (and the leftover eye makeup).

it removes makeup but i don't think you should rely totally on this one product for that, especially if you have dry skin to start out with.  i completely soaked a cotton pad swiped it over everything and then swiped that over my face a few times, concentrating on the mascara. it didn't cause any eye irritation.  then i turned that pad over and swiped again.  that removed almost all of the makeup, including some heavy duty concealer.  i did rinse this off my face before applying moisturizer.

anyway please try this, and i'm hoping you'll have the same experience as me.  i swear by it now.

my daily regimen is to first wash my face with cetaphil, a gentle cleanser.  then i proceed with cleaning my face with a cotton round and a few shakes of this product .. i squeeze out the excess before commencing to wipe down my face, flip the pad and repeat.. then i toss it out, and rinse my face with plain water, as i don't like the cleanser on my face even (though i've left it on before with no issues other than a tight sensation). it's just don't like how my lips taste (a bit bitter), and i prefer to have absolutely nothing on my face before hitting the sack.",2017-05-02,5,3,A9X2MLWQOALBW,B000V3MHA2

my wife has been using this for about a week. she applies it to cotton balls and then wipes away her makeup with the moistened cotton balls saturated with the solution. the scent is mildly reminiscent of a rose water type of scent. although she is happy with it, she frets that it takes quite a bit of the solution to remove her makeup (and she doesn't wear excessive amounts of makeup i might add) and she fears that the cost of this, being rather high compared to what she normally uses, that she doubts she would purchase this again in the future.

after my shower this morning, i decided to try this out on my face just to see what it smelled like and how well it worked at simply deep cleaning my skin. i saturated a cotton ball and wiped my face, under my eyes, nose and forehead with it. i was quite surprised at how dirty the cotton ball was even though i had moments before washed my face quite thoroughly while taking my shower,

******************************************************
i have combination skin.

as a toner, i really like this - it doesn't have a strong, identifiable fragrance at all, it goes on smoothly, and it feels nice. after applying it, my skin feels good - not dry, and definitely not oily.

but as a make-up remover, i found i needed to go over my face two or three times to get most of the make-up off. i would not recommend this to remove make-up; i think it's just too gentle (which is great as a toner but eh as a make-up remover).",2017-04-29,4,3,A2M6J4CGEA29JI,B000V3MHA2
1686,"i have tried several la roche-posay products and while i haven't disliked any of them, there are a few i've been "that's ok but no big deal" and a couple i really like and buy again, like their cream foaming cleanser.

i really like this one, though i can't tell the difference between the micellar water thing and an oily skin toner. the scent on this one is terrific. i don't really know how to describe it. maybe a little citrusy, and maybe a little floral, maybe something like cucumber, but it's an intriguing scent without being feminine or medicinal.

it's like a toner for me in that while it seems to clean the skin nicely and leave it (after using it on a cotton pad) feeling refreshed, it does leave that slight feel of "something on the skin" that many toners do. it's not unpleasant, but it's definitely not like the skin would feel after being washed and rinsed.

so if you think of it as a gentle, but pretty effective toner for oily skin you'll get the idea. price-wise it's middle of the road and it'll last long enough that if you like the scent you'll keep getting it but it doesn't seem to be to be worth it otherwise.",2017-04-29,4,3,AR74YY08IP2WE,B000V3MHA2

i love toleriane purifying foaming cleanser made by the same company - it is foaming gel and it cleanses skin without irritation and any residue left. now i use the foaming cleanser in the shower, and if i feel the need to clean my face, i use micellar water, but make sure i rinse it after use.",2017-04-25,3,3,A397CWU6DM3O5G,B000V3MHA2
1692,"great mild oil cleansing water.

 over 20 years ago  or longer, when i would purchase a skin care system, it would include an astringent product that you would put on with a cotton ball  before  applying the moisturizers. the first time i reviewed one of many water-based cleansers such as this one, i was tempted to use them the same as i would an astringent  toner. perhaps now these water-based products are more prevalent. there does appear to be many of them out on the market.  i have just noticed that. while some conventional cleansers might do very well at removing dirt, and leaving some residue, there is nothing better in my opinion than wiping my face clean until the cotton pad shows no signs of make up for dirt.

i have found that with these particular types of products, they are gentle cleansers that you do not  need to wash off; they are also products that i assume would replace a regular daily cleanser,  and would be applied with a cotton ball or cotton pad. for the exception of removing waterproof mascara and eyeliner,  this product  is just great for me. i might have this bias based on the fact that i have been using products like this for a couple of years. when i use a particular cleanser -  let's say a traditional one such as something soap-based  i  eventually take a shower anyway, so my quandary is, do i put my moisturizer on after the shower?  no, i  use a water-based  cleanser. this one is particularly for oily skin and, this particular brand has some very effective products that prevent breakouts. they also treat  breakouts.  however, i do not look at this product as something drying to the skin; if anything it promotes the balance of the skin.  in that way it is gentle.  this product is not really a toner, as with the alcohol-based toner. it is clean,clear, gentle. while this product has some fragrance, it is barely detectable.  however, unlike the other water-based products i use, this has a slight bit of suds if i'm not mistaken. only a bit of bubbly only on the surface of the liquid as if it has been shaken.  very little though.  this is a very pure product sans alcohol and soap.  i have often wondered if a product that is made up mainly of water can be effective.  then i am reminded how most cleansers or washes make me break out.

i recommend this one in particular because of its claim of being oil free. and since i liked the mask that i got from this company a while back,  i now  use a mask on my face periodically, and then apply this product afterword  - and always before moisturizer which i use day and night.  it's a wonderful thing. i recommend this brand and this product. by the way, i use a stronger one that is more emollient to clean off my waterproof mascara and eyeliner.  i don't need facials because the oil free cleanser made by this company eliminates oil buildup which appear as rough skin as on my nose, making my skin clear to be cleaned and good to go.",2017-04-22,5,5,ACJ9N7ED37HXS,B000V3MHA2

1702,"i always stocked up on micellar water products when i went to france - they've used it & loved it for years.  it was supposedly invented for parisian women because the water in paris is so "hard".  the water is hard there, i can vouch for that & that is why the pharmacy was always one of my first stops when arriving in paris.  hard water makes it difficult to remove your makeup & tends to dry out the skin.

this is good micellar water for oily skin.  it has a light scent, removes my makeup & does not irritate my skin.  i often use this to clean my skin on days i am not wearing makeup. i don't feel the need to rinse with water after using it but it does leave a light scent behind.  i do use this water on a cotton pad to remove makeup although it does not remove waterproof makeup as easily as the garnier micellar with the blue cap.

this is not a toner or just a makeup remover so you use it a bit differently.  you soak a cotton pad with it & then place it over your eye or wherever & just hold in place for a few seconds  let it gently do the work for you.  you don't need to rub everything off.  you let it soak in & then gently move the cotton pad without rubbing.

this stuff is not magic, it is science & it has been around for a long time.  the micelle surfactant molecule is suspended in liquid/water and kind of grabs on to the dirt/oils/makeup on your face & doesn't allow it to stick on your face.  (that is my simple, non-scientist explanation.)  there is no irritation - even around eyes.  and the skin actually feels clean without rinsing with tap water.  when you use it, it seems like you are just using regular tap water except it actually dissolves/grabs the goo/makeup off your face.",2017-04-18,4,5,AW6J9IILGOZY3,B000V3MHA2

what i don't like about this micellar water is it feels like it leaves a coating on my face, which i have to rinse off with regular water from the sink.

1704,"this is my 2nd juice beauty product.  the 1st i used is the green apple peel sensitive which i love!  when i find a product i love, i always like to try other products from the brand.  i received a generous sample of the flouride hydratant anti-age moisturizer, said to reduce wrinkles with firming peptides.

i am naturally drawn to any product that says "firming peptides".  i'm in my 30's, my skin is starting to sag a little bit and needs a little boost.  this product is made with certified organic ingredients, another plus.  it also contains alpha lipoic acid, coq10 (a firming agent), vitamin c, peptides and dmae.  it sounds like a really great product.

the very first time i used it, i didn't like the smell.  it didn't smell like apples or like the peel at all.  to me, it smells like a regular jergens lotion mixed with a hint of a clay mask.  i also found this moisturizer to be very thick and heavy.  i started applying it at night only to see how it would feel on my skin.  right away my skin felt heavy and greasy.  i have natural oily skin so this was a bad combination for me.  when i woke up the next morning my face felt like an oil slick.  to give the product a fair shot, i used it again in the am, under makeup, which was a total disaster.  i applied my liquid foundation over top and because the product had never fully absorbed, rather sat on top of the skin, my skin was so sticky all day.  i felt like my face was so dirty.

the price point, in my opinion is very high too.  for $45, i have found many other moisturizers that work better on my oily skin.  this product may be good for someone with really dry skin that needs super duper moisture, but for a girl with oily skin, it's no good.",2016-03-02,3,5,AON853FSY8RNJ,B000W0XVNG

1707,"i didn't expect to like this, thinking it was just another basic moisturizer (but with organic ingredients - yawn). but color me impressed.

shea butter is the 2nd ingredient after the "juices".  because of this, the texture is actually a delight -- imagine shea butter diluted down to an emulsion, creating a thin, flexible, protective film on your face that acts as a barrier/primer.  it has that matte drydown often found in shea, but is much thinner and lighter -- the slight firming sensation acts as a temporary "freeze" while filling in pores and fine lines. amazingly, i found it effective as a wind chafing barrier, cushioning my face from the biting cold. i love that it is non-oily in texture, allowing me to layer stuff over it. no pilling at all -- compatible with your other serums/sunscreens/foundations.

now, a moisturizer that simply hydrates is not good enough! we demand more from our products these days. to show truly efficacious results, this cream has to do something else. that's where the aha's come in. the fruit acids to act as low level aha's (i'd guess it's 5% or less), so you won't see visible brightness overnight -- but over a few weeks, you'll feel your skin texture getting smoother, more refined.

the aha's are crucial in this product because without them, your dead skin cells would just accumulate, and the lipid ingredients in this cream would simply bind those dead cells together, causing dullness and clogs. also it is silicone-free (silicone is notorious for causing clogs), and it has other "good-for-you" nutrients like antioxidants and dmae. but really--it's the aha's that do the most.

in summary, this formulation is a good combo of light aha's and hydrating ingredients while steering clear of the "no-no"s. if you are looking for an immediate refining/ brightening effect, only a professional peel or ipl/laser treatment would do that; i'd recommend this cream as a good "maintenance" cream that gradually further refines skin on a slower basis, albeit much gentler.",2014-11-22,4,3,AZ26CDSJ363AH,B000W0XVNG
1708,"*note: i've changed my original rating from 4 stars to 5 stars because i've found that after using juice beauty's green apple age defy moisturizer for over a month, my face has noticeably brightened and become ultra smooth and hydrated. i already liked this moisturizer and saw (see original review below) benefits after using it for just a week. after a month, it's benefits are more evident, and it's become an essential component to my daily moisturizing routine.

this is my first time using a juice beauty product, and i'm impressed. moisturizing is a twice a day standard in my routine. i always put on bobbi brown's eye moisturizer, and aveeno's daily moisturizer with spf under my foundation. however, i also now need to up my moisturizer for the brutally drying winter months, and this organic green apple antioxidant light moisturizer has already done several things very well.

it's has soothed, plumped, and softened my skin, it's worked well as a base for my liquid foundation, and it has minimized the pores across my nose, and evened-out my skin tone. in addition, it goes on easily with great coverage using a small amount, and it isn't greasy. it sinks in very well on my face, and doesn't creep down into my eyes. it works well on my neck as well (very soothing). i do find that it doesn't sink in as well on my dcollet, this is noticeable at shower time, when you can feel it sitting on the top layers of the skin (doesn't happen with the face and neck). the light citrus-woodsy scent is very nice.

so--the scent is really nice. i was neither crazy about it nor hated it when i first tried this, but as i've been using it the scent has grown on me to the point i can say i genuinely like it.

it goes on smoothly. i rub it between my palms and then gently spread it over my face and neck (except on my nose and to either side, where i tend to have oily skin). i found it goes on and absorbs better that way than using my fingertips. it makes my skin feel soft, and not greasy.

love that it's made from organic ingredients.

i've been using it morning and night. i have a feeling that would be too often for me if i were using this during the summer here in florida, but it's been cooler and dryer lately, so twice a day has been just right.

composition and effectiveness: many of the ingredients are organic and nature-based, which is a big selling point for me compared to many of the drugstore and department store products. the ingredients include antioxidants that should help prevent signs of aging. experiences are very subjective, but i will try to update this as i use this product over time.

my wife, 40 years old with normal to dry skin, has been using this product daily (morning and night) for one week and the results of this moisturizer are already being noticed:

positives:

- the cream has a light, supple texture than applies thinly and evenly.

- upon application, the moisturizer leaves the skin with a dewiness that generates a brighter appearance, but never oily or greasy.

- subsequent applications have left the skin feeling noticeably smoother and firmer.

- the ingredients are natural.

- reasonably priced, especially considering the results.

caution:

- this product is not super-moisturizing and may not yield the same results for those with very dry skin.

i used this product over several days while in sf with my gf--we were staying with my mom. i mention this because we got a wide variety of skin types to test this product out. as mentioned early it is thick on everyone. the apple smell is amazing. the age defy part though... thats a little nebulous.
my mother who's in her 50's  saw little change, but loved it as a before bed leave on product. she swore in the morning it filled in some of the lines. as thick as this product is, and as long as it takes to set in, i can very much believe that it does rejuvenate some of the dry lines in her face, though it was hard for us to notice anything... but she seemed to like it so thats something?
my partner who's in her 20's hated this product. her skin is naturally very oily and she thought it felt slick and thick and just not pleasant. her laugh lines and slight lines around her eyes saw zero change. she was the first to stop using it after just a few applications because she just hated how it felt and had to wipe it down to apply makeup even an hour later.
lastly i was probably the most apathetic about it. my skin is drier so i didn't mind the thickness, especially right before bed. it still took a little longer than i would have liked to absorb, but i didn't have any major problems like my gf. but that being said i also didn't see any major benefit over this and any other thicker natural moisturizer i've used from kiehls or even neutrogena norwegian formula.

all in all 2oz isn't great, but its about standard for a high end beauty product so while its not great in the value department its not bad as these things go. and if you realize its a heavier product for either exclusively nighttime use or for very dry skin, that will probably do more to keep you from having weathered skin than anything to actually reverse the process you're gonna get more use out of it. on the other hand if the most important thing to you is that a moisturizer smell so goo you want to eat it, than i can unequivocally recommend this product. id give it 3.5 stars.",2014-11-03,4,3,A1H6SBO7R007I8,B000W0XVNG

1724,"so basically i'm not a super duper girlie girl.  i'm fine with the basic skin products you find at your local drug store.  still, when this popped up in vine, i figured i'd give it a shot - it seemed to be bragging about being organic and i frankly wanted to know if that really  makes this little container worth about six times as much as the big bottle of what i'd usually buy at said local drug store.

first off, i'm kind of confused about what can and cannot be labeled organic but they did put that label on most most of their ingredients.  organic or not, none of their ingredients seem too offensive (unless, of course, you're allergic to them).

there is a slight scent but it's not very offensive, which is good as my body really really really dislikes most scents.  i tend to get migraines or just sick to my stomach if there is a chemical scent or even a natural scent that is too strong.  this didn't bug me.

as for how it works - i have pretty dry skin.  it  absorbs anything with moisture then wants more more more.  this kind of just sat on top for awhile before finally get all sucked up.  it doesn't take very much - the old a little goes a long way.  my skin does feel fairly decent after using it but i'm not sure it's any better than the cheaper alternatives i have available to me.  i'll use up what i have but probably wouldn't buy it again - only because i'm a cheapskate and the cheaper stuff doesn't aggravate my sensitive skin.  if i didn't have alternatives that already worked for me, i'd probably go ahead and use this - very sparingly - i said i'm a cheapskate.",2014-11-02,4,3,A2E0TJ49NACDBA,B000W0XVNG

yes, it's in glass, which is fabulous! you can save it after use (just run it through the dishwasher). i'll use it for some of my homemade creams.

ingredients
wonderful, healthy, and safe. i use the ewg's cosmetic database to look up all my cosmetics and the juice beauty products come up in the totally safe category. you can find their web site by just googling ewg's cosmetic database, then enter your cosmetic you want to know about.  this face cream has the fruit juices:
apple
grape
lemon
i has all the moisturizers i put in my homemade recipe:
aloe vera
shea butter
jojoba
primrose
borage
all of these are great for aging skin and moisturizing any-age skin too. there's also lots of other plant extracts.

i don't know about it's ant-aging effects since i've only used it for a few days, but it has left my skin soft feeling. there is a scent to it but not too much of one. it's one i associate with lotions. i'm very pleased with it.",2014-11-01,4,5,ADYZOSTF9LZLD,B000W0XVNG
1730,"compared to the juice beauty nutrient moisturizer, this is worth the higher price. both have the same delightfully subtle lemon scent, but this one is much more hydrating.

i normally use josie maran's 100% pure argan oil as my nighttime moisturizer (which is magic--i'm in my thirties and i have zero wrinkles or crows feet) and the juice beauty green apple age defy moisturizer left my skin feeling almost as soft and hydrated as the argan oil. plus it's less expensive than the argan oil--depending on usage.

i have oily/combination skin, my mom has dry skin, and we were both impressed with this moisturizer.  i'm not ready to give up my magic argan oil for nighttime, but as easily as this absorbs, i could see it becoming my new favorite daytime moisturizer.

1732,"i didn't really care for this moisturizer all that much.  i love the gel cleanser and "age defy" serum from the same line, so i had high hopes for this.

it does do some things right.  for example, the ingredients are great (you can see the list by viewing one of the product images of the back of the container; you may have to enlarge it), as is always the case with juice beauty.  it's good for sensitive skin, i found, as well -- i've had no ill effects from trying this out.

please note that this contains willow bark extract; salicylic acid is a component of willow bark extract.  so proceed with caution if you are allergic to or sensitive to aspirin.  also, it's best to use a sunscreen when also using hydroxy acids like salicylic acid.  (on the other hand, salicylic acid is great for me for clearing up breakouts so it may help in that regard.)  this product does not contain any spf ingredients, although juice beauty does make a different moisturizer that might be good during the day.

this is fairly moisturizing, but the thing i really didn't like is that i couldn't get it to rub into my skin.  i applied it sparingly, as is my habit with moisturizers, but there was still white residue all over my face even after rubbing for a little while.  it didn't end up affecting my makeup a whole lot (which is good), but i'm really pale and this showed up and i think it would be even more obvious for people with darker skin.  if you plan to use this at night, it may not be a problem.

i did not notice any dramatic differences, but i really don't have a huge problem with fine lines to begin with -- i use antiaging products mostly as a preventive measure.  if you're looking for help with fine lines, the "age defy" serum from juice beauty is quite moisturizing and has (vegetarian) hyaluronic acid, and i'd probably recommend that instead.

in the end, this is ok but not great, and i like other products from the same brand better.",2014-10-31,3,3,A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,B000W0XVNG

1736,"when i think of free radicals, i think of people waving signs in the street, protesting this or that government decision. but there is another kind of free radical. this kind of free radical is related to an atom or molecule that "has a single unpaired electron in an outer shell."

the ingredients include age-defying peptides, dmae, alpha lipoic acid, fat-soluble and coq10. like those free radicals, i don't really understand all of them, but i do know this serum has a very pleasing, yet understated aroma. it blends into the skin smoothly, and once there it is undetectable. it feels good, too. only time will tell if it's a fountain of youth in a bottle, but for now i give it high marks.",2014-11-02,4,5,A2CZPM110DW516,B000W14OOA

1740,"there are a lot of positives to this product.  i've been using this product for several weeks now and have never experience the burning sensation which other reviewers noted; however, it must be noted that i do not have particularly sensitive skin, either.  i have combination skin, so take that as you will.

if i apply this after my normal cleansing ritual and before applying moisturizer, it does reduce the look of fine lines (and i'm a former smoker, so i'm always happy to reduce the appearance of wrinkles which prematurely aged my skin through my own folly), but the effect does not seem to be permanent and fades after a few hours. which isn't the worst thing that a product like this can do.

i've tried several beauty serums - mostly free samples - and thus far have not found one which works on my skin to produce the purported effects which the marketing departments claim.  on the other hand, this serum is organic and not full of nasty chemicals. it has a pleasant scent which i did not find overpowering.  it is also not oily and did not make me break out, as many of the beauty serums have done in the past, so i consider that a win, as well.

although i do not believe that this serum has had a permanent age-reversing effect on my skin, as a temporary measure, it works very well. the one thing i don't particularly like about this serum is that my face feels sticky after application, which is slightly unsettling. but this does not interact with my moisturizer, primer or foundation makeup, so it's just a mild inconvenience. overall, for this price (which is slightly below the upper market products on sephora), this is a decent addition to one's skin care regimen, though i do not feel that the effects are long-lasting, so you should consider that before you purchase.",2014-12-04,4,3,A19Z4IDNL1MGG4,B000W14OOA

1749,"i've tried a lot of serums in the past year.  i'd say this one measures up to most, if not all, of them.  i don't have a huge problem with fine lines yet, but the idea is to start using anti-aging products now (in my mid/late 30s) to prevent issues in the future.

i love that this has hyaluronic acid from a vegetarian/plant source, and i'm super glad it says so on the label.  most hyaluronic acid is a byproduct of poultry processing so i'm very happy to see a non-animal source in a product.  and i would argue that the vegetable hyaluronic acid in this product works as well as any other.  i felt an almost immediate (but not unpleasant) tightening of my skin when i used this.  in general, hyaluronic acid hangs on to a lot of moisture -- that's what generates the plumping and wrinkle filling effects.  i used a moisturizer after this, but i probably didn't need to!

i found this to be moisturizing but also to be suitable to use under makeup.  i tried it in the morning and my makeup performed as expected.  (i've recently had an experience with a different product where this was not the case, so i definitely think it's worth mentioning!)  this means that this serum could be used both morning and evening, if you prefer.

please note that this contains willow bark extract, so it has some salicylic acid in it.  keep this in mind if you are allergic or sensitive to aspirin.  salicylic acid is wonderful (for me, at least) for clearing up blemishes and breakouts and i feel this product helped with that.  you will probably want to wear sunscreen if using this product because of the willow bark extract; this serum does also contain some antioxidants which will help with sun damage (for example, from the black tea leaf extract and grape juice).

this has a nice texture and smell with no artificial fragrances or dyes.  the large number of plant extracts should be suitable for sensitive skin, although consider doing a patch test first, as always, if you are concerned.  i, personally, didn't have any issues.

i like the texture and thought this applied smoothly and without leaving a residue, though it did take a moment or two to fully dry.  you don't need a whole lot to get full coverage of your face and neck, either, so one bottle should last a long time.

1754,"this serum works a little bit... nothing revolutionary, but "a little bit" is definitely better than nothing for fine lines. i had assumed it was a moisturizer, but it's not--you apply it after cleansing and before moisturizing. the texture is a runny gel--a bit thicker than water, but not much (e.g., lighter than any lotions). i sometimes have sensitive skin but this didn't bother me at all, and after a few days my forehead lines looked a tiny bit better, though the ones on my cheeks and near my eyes looked about the same.

i love that it's all natural, so i don't have to worry as much about side effects you might see with long-term use of phtalates, pegs, tea, dea, pesticides, artificial dyes, fragrances, etc. i'd probably keep using it, but for the current price of $52/bottle (and fairly tiny size--it doesn't seem like it will last more than a month or two), i don't know that i can justify it just for a tiny bit of reduction in fine lines.

i suggest also checking out andalou brand products, which are far more moderately priced, all-natural, and work extremely well on my skin (thin, pale, dry and a bit sensitive).",2014-11-09,4,4,ALUV2YKWZENKK,B000W14OOA
1755,"this serum is less thick and has a more watery consistency than other beauty serums that i've used in the past.  it has a tendency to want to run between my fingers; which i don't like as it's rather expensive.  my biggest grip about this product is that it is impossible to use it conservatively.  the pump only dispenses the product in full measures, you cannot gently press the pump to only emit 1/2 of the product.  i routinely need about 1 1/2 pumps to fully cover my face and neck however i get enough product by depressing the pump twice that invariably i am rubbing it into my hands and  shoulders in an effort to not completely waste it by wiping it off with a hand towel.  considering that this product is priced around $50 an ounce (not hugely expensive but certainly not priced to be a hand cream), i would much rather have a better pump dispenser to ensure that i am not pumping out more than what i really need to use.

there is a very slight scent of apple from the product.  due to the watery consistency, it takes longer is absorb into my skin than other "age defying" products.  you'll need to wait several minutes before applying your moisturizer over top of this product.  this product is designed to be applied after cleansing the face (morning and night) and after the serum is applied, apply your typical moisturizer.  this is not a stand alone moisturizer.

on a plus side - it's not sticky nor does it interfere with the application of foundation or powder.  my skin has not experienced any redness or breakouts with this product and it does not produce oiliness.  i should note that i have "normal" skin (not sensitive) and i typically have problems with oil on the sides of my nose - this product does not accentuated this problem (i've used many that have).

the list of  ingredients are the typical "age defying" ingredients that you'll find in most over-the-counter products.  i don't expect a miracle product with any over-the-counter beauty product.  right now, this product is not accentuating my fine lines, it doesn't compete with my cosmetics (meaning that it doesn't make my foundation heavy), and my face feels smooth after using it - for me and my 40 plus skin, that is enough.  the only product that i've ever found to lighten my dark spots (due to too much sun expose as a teenage - sigh....., if i could only turn back the hands of time) is a light application of good old fashion concealer.

all in all, this isn't my favorite product (i still prefer the olay age defying line).",2014-11-08,3,3,A1UUI7PFQ5FU4E,B000W14OOA
1756,"i wanted to try this primarily for the skin brightening, but also to combat fine lines. the ingredient list wasn't full of scary things so it was worth trying.

fine lines- the acidic skin peel effect is very mild, and there hasn't been enough time to really tell if it's helping the fine lines around my mouth and eyes. the appearance of them is minimized though after application.

skin brightening- this is more obvious. i have a largish freckle on the tip of my nose, and it is noticeably lighter. it's not gone, but i can actually camouflage it with make up now without pulling out the serious concealer.

i like how well it applies, it smooths easily, and when it's dry it's lightweight and nearly unnoticeable.",2014-11-07,4,5,A1GYEGLX3P2Y7P,B000W14OOA

plus as the product states there are all kinds of other benefits that do help in the long run such as fighting free radicals and sun damage.

update: i was getting ready to purchase a refill for my compact and ended up thinking 35.00 (lowest price on amazon) was just alittle pricey. the pressed powder seem to not last me very long :( starting to look around for something else. i ended up buying milani multitasking face powder in the color light tan and love it. i did half my face with jane iredale and the other with milani. milani won hands down. better matte coverage and much better lasting power. best part was the color was the same and i spent a total of 5.00 for two compacts!",2014-12-27,5,5,A3IL4YCLWGPRWJ,B000YBNL2Y

1843,"amazing! i have been looking for the exact shade for over 22 yrs and i have found it in golden glow! i am mixed and have a more yellowish undertone and very hard to find any kind of makeup with more yellow in it. usually i get a beige muddy look (almost ruddy) and/or a pinkish undertone. i hate looking two-toned. this takes the redness out and matches the rest of my body from the neck down and it's amazing in photos! i ordered a sample from bloft cosmetics for $7 since i wasn't sure what my exact shade was and i wasn't about to shell out that much money for a product that didn't match (just like every other foundation/powder) and i'm sure glad i found a sample which has a decent amount btw. i stiple it on my face with my philosophy multi brush and so far that is the best method and best brush imo. i never really used it but only for blending into my nose and around my nose area and under my eyes but using it to stiple and then blend and stiple works flawlessy! my face is so smooth and flawless and almost as if i am not wearing makeup. i cannot stress enough how much a miracle this is to me. i am def purchasing the refill, not sure about the compact but who knows, i think i am becoming a jane iredale fan! just in case you are wondering, i am nc30(winter) and nc35 (summer)...as of now, i am the lightest nc30 and this is perfect! my pores don't react to this and i don't break out...this stuff looks much more better than bareminerals or any other foundation i have ever tried! even better than mac mineralized skin finish! mac looks more made up but this is so natural and you can easily build it up to a more made up look as well. i am def going to try their hydration spray and their bb cream!!!

edit:2/11/2015

1853,"the older one gets, the thinner the hair, especially for light-complected people like me. also, when aging one tends to pay less attention to fine details like the eyebrows.

however, to me, the brows are even more important than  eye-liner, which i gave up years ago. :-) but i insist on that perfect arch on the brow with medium width hairs. i can't stand the look of the very thin-lined brow reminiscent of earlier ages; thin lines tend to age the entire face, imo. i see a lot of young girls who pluck their brows too thin, instantly aging them and detracting from the eyes. hmmm...

since my brows are so light it's hard to pluck them just right, but i have a tool that helps with that too. :-) after i pluck them, applying this excellent pencil is easy. the color is perfect for my coloring--no reddish cast as some blonde pencils tend to produce.

as excellent as this product is for me and other blonde/gray women, it's the shape of the brows that make a huge difference in the brightness of the eyes.

i love this pencil...and the little sharpener that comes with it is a nice bonus.

highly recommended for fair-skinned, lighter-haired people.

1854,"this vincent longo eyebrow pencil is a perfectly acceptable substitute for the department-store branded one i have been using for years. the blonde color is absolutely perfect for me - a nice light brown that is very, very natural. i like the precision tip due to the micro size. however, the micro pencil is very hard to sharpen evenly! i feel that for $20, which is a bit more than the double-sized department store pencil i usually use, vincent longo could at least include a custom-sized sharpener similar to those which other manufacturers have provided as an integral part of eye pencil caps (clinique, for example). even though i like this pencil very much, and have been using it every day, i will not purchase a replacement. you get less for your money with this pencil. i won't pay for just the name - it has to be better than what i have been using (which also has an eyebrow grooming brush) - clearly, to me, it is not.",2014-03-26,3,1,A3H5QGH5OD2XGX,B000Z5YBK0

1856,"i have never used an eyebrow pencil. my eyebrows are naturally pretty well formed on their own.  but i must admit i've been wanting to make them a tad bit more arched and mainly even them out.  i was worried about having that typical "painted on look". boy, i had nothing to worry about!  i made little marks to mimic my natural hair and i was amazed at how natural my eyebrows looked!  i couldn't even tell looking up close that i had done anything, but it made all the difference in the world.  really, just adding in 6 more "hairs" and it totally changed the look of my eyebrows, but it still looks completely natural.  really amazing!

and i have to say the quality of this little box that arrived is top notch and totally worth the price. it has it's own sharpener that made for it, a very fancy little box and directions, and a lid for the pencil too.  i am so glad i took the leap and tried.  enjoy!",2014-03-20,5,5,AUV3OR951650C,B000Z5YBK0
1857,"it's hard to give an objective review when i've only been able to use this about five times before the tip wore down rendering it unusable as i need very thin, soft strokes which a stub cannot give.

there was no sharpener in the package i received. i tried using other brow pencil sharpeners but none worked (they only wore down the tip). the lack of proper sharpener may have affected application but not the other elements (texture, color, look when applied, price/value ratio) that are a part of evaluating this pencil's effectiveness.

i've used a wide variety of eyebrow pencils over the years at a variety of price points. the best are easy to apply in that they don't seem to cake or clump and go on evenly (with a well-sharpened tip) and don't smudge; you can shape the tip as needed to give thicker or thinner lines. the consistency (a bit waxy but not too much), which you can't try before you buy, is a key factor in both application and longevity, once applied.

other than the color itself, there's nothing that i liked about this product. which is disappointing as this is a good brand and i've used other longo products and been satisfied with their performance. it's especially disappointing given the price point.

application: not as easy as other pencils, which is due, in part, i think, to the consistency (waxy, clumpy) and the size of the tip (too small and chubby and not thin enough to my liking).

texture: not as smooth as other pencils i've used. took longer to apply and had to keep smudging and fiddling with q-tips to get a neat line. didn't go on "evenly."

look when applied: seemed heavier and line was not as strong and consistent. getting a thin line was very difficult (again, an issue of consistency and size/shape of product tip)

color: this was a really good color for me, even though i have medium brown hair. i have found that many products labeled "blonde" are the right shade either alone or when used to lighten up a darker color.

price/value: simply not there for me. i've had better application, better looking brows with pencils that were cheaper. but since a person's brows (color, texture, etc.) differ greatly, this may work better for you than me. i have thin-ish brows and need thin, really feathery lines, which this could not deliver.",2014-03-20,2,3,A221I9R7I92ORO,B000Z5YBK0

i have used sephora's eyebrow kit (which comes with stencils and two blendable shades) which i love, but this pencil is easier to use and more portable.

1860,"i have used a lot of different brow products over time, and one thing that i have a difficult time finding is a brow product that does not settle into the skin, pores, or smear while wearing in the day.

i have used the vincent longo blonde micro pencil for several weeks now and i have to say that it does not wear well.  the pencil goes in nicely with very fine lines and it is easy to apply and make faux hairs in the brow area.

the color is nice- very close to mac lingering or tarte taupe brow pencils in color.

the pencil itself is very thin, which means that you have to use a special sharpener.  the sharpener is not attached at all to the pencil, so if you lose it, you are out of luck.  i don't like that feature.

what i have found with this pencil is that despite it looking very close in color to the other two which i have previously mentioned, it does not wear as well.  i have done one brow with this pencil and a different one on the other.  at the end of the day, the other brand is still good, but the vincent longo pencil is smeary, spotty, and seems to have settled into my pores a bit too.

i do not have oily skin.

for the price, i don't think that this brow pencil works for me anyway.  nice color, but very disappointing wear time.  i don't want to have to try that hard with any brow products. i prefer to apply and not have to think about it for the rest of the day.",2014-03-12,2,3,AWIF8AR75LL9L,B000Z5YBK0

1862,"the great thing about this pencil is its thin fine point. as someone who tweezed my eyebrows to the point of non-existence, i have become adept at filling my eyebrows in. most products out there are either powders that wear off quickly or thicker point pencils that create an artificial brow line.
i played around with this pencil for an hour and got the hang of proper application which involved short precise strokes that mimic fine hairs. as i continued to experiment i achieved a brow line that works for me and compliments my dark blonde hair. the pencil application works all day and is easily removed with my facial cleanser.
i liked this product and think it is one of the better eyebrow products i've tried. a little goes a long way.",2014-03-09,4,4,A2ZY49IDE6TY5I,B000Z5YBK0

personally, have found the pencil to be my favorite.

after using this pencil and comparing my personal favorite...inexpensive avon glimmerstick in blonde, i prefer the avon.  while the avon does not have the sharpener feature, i can control the application by very gently using the this retractable pencil on an angle.

vincent longo's product has the following:
pros:
thin pencil
nice light blonde color
excellent sharpener with receptacle attached to collect shavings

cons:
expensive
hard pencil...found it difficult to use on my brow line...prefer a softer pencil

1865,"after using this pencil a while, i've decided to remove two stars. that's because i cannot replicate it's original fine point. the sharpener that came with it does a poor job -- the usual breaking of the "lead" in this pencil, which results in a dollar's worth of loss each time.

perhaps better attention should have been paid to the selection of wood or better quality control in actually testing the product on the sharpener attached.  it seems that the original manufacturing process produces a point that might not be available to the average consumer. disappointed!

---------

i must admit, when i first selected this as a vine product i thought to myself, "who would pay $20 for an eyebrow pencil?"  now i'm wondering if i should stock up.

how does this compare to other high-end pencils? i cannot say; i have little patience in navigating the very expensive department store brands.  i can favorably compare this vincent longo pencil, however, to the more expensive drug-store options from l'oreal and revlon: they are generally half the price but also half the length (or less) and half the quality.

here are the things i like about this pencil:

1. the color is "blonde."  even though my hair is mid-to-dark brown, i learned long ago to use an eyebrow shade much lighter than my hair; "blonde" is usually best. (a small quibble: i would have preferred an even lighter blonde, but that's a personal preference.)

2. the point is very fine (yet not vulnerable to breaking, as with the drugstore versions). this means you truly can sketch the small lines that emulate eyebrow hairs instead of drawing on a big blob of color.

3. the compound's consistency  means it has staying power. no running or "migrating."  it also adds a little body so that you when brush the brow, everything stays where it's supposed to.

4. the sharpener is the perfect fit for this tiny point.",2014-03-06,3,3,A30ODR6WBE61UB,B000Z5YBK0
1866,"for me, make up should naturally enhance my looks, not look fake.  this eyebrow pencil sure fits the bill.  i have pale skin with blond eyebrows, so the eyebrows disappear into my face.

why i love this product:

* the thin pencil makes nice, natural filler lines.  its easy to draw them so they look real.  other eyebrow pencils i have used are thicker, so the lines are not as natural looking.

* the sharpener and little scraper thingie that comes with the pencil.  i don't have to hunt around for an old make up sharpener, plus i don't have to find a pin to stick in the sharpener to clean it out.

i wasn't sure what to think about this product when i first poured some onto my palms---it is an "oily-feeling" treatment, and i feared it would make my baby fine hair look greasy. in fact, i knew i'd put too much onto my hands, and wiped some of it away, so a little will go a long way (this product will last me forever!). i then worked the infusion from about ear-length down to the ends into my just-washed hair--i did not put any at the roots. then i blow-dried with a round brush. at first, i didn't think it did much, but when i walked out of the bathroom, my guy said, "wow! your hair looks beautiful! what did you do differently?" he ran his fingers through it, "it's soft and silky - sexy!"

i marched back into the bathroom and looked at my hair - yup, smooth, shiny, and silky all right. and after sleeping on it all night - even tossing and turning -- i woke to smooth silky hair! okay, so, i'm sold!

if you have baby fine hair as i do, don't over-do it -- just use maybe a dime-sized at most, and don't apply it to the roots - also, work it in really well into wet/damp hair, and then blow dry with a round brush--though i want to try it without blow drying to see what it will do. i also noticed it made my hi-lights look better - i think it must be the "smoothing" effects that allowed my hi-lights to shine, but whatever the case, this product works for me.

1894,"now, mind you, i'm testing this in april-may, not the really horrendously humid summer months here in florida, so i may have to edit this review in two or three months if this product doesn't hold its own against serious florida weather.  however, we've had some days already into the 90+ degrees with a lot of humidity, so i've got a pretty good idea of what this chi silk infusion can do.

there are several things i like about this:

1)  leaves hair shiny and soft.

2)  actually does help straighten out the waves and curls, even without a flat iron.

3)  smells rather pleasant.  a lot like a cologne an ex-man-in-my-life used.  (i asked my husband if the scent was familiar to him and he said no, so this must have been in b.h. times [before husband].)

4)  only requires a dime- to nickel-sized dab, depending on how long and how voluminous your hair is.  more is actually not a good idea.  causes less shine and less softness in my case.

5)  even seems to add a bit of body to my hair.

my only reservation about the product is all the multisyllabic chemical ingredients in this.  i hope they're safe for people and for the environment because it's one of the best leave-in treatments i've found for my frizzy grey hair.",2015-05-05,4,5,AUZ3EJAU37NC5,B00103DUZS

chi silk infusion does a great job of protecting your hair from heat damage. if you use the correct amount, it will add shine, not be greasy and help to dry your hair faster than if you left your hair in its natural state.

chi silk infusion does not have a strong odor, but a light fragrance that disappears as your hair dries. all in all, it's a great product that will become a staple for me.",2015-04-30,5,5,A3TIJLY4VX8CH3,B00103DUZS

1902,"this is a leave-in hair conditioner so a little goes a very very long way.

after shampooing, spread a very tiny pea-sized amount in your hands and apply to damp towel-dried hair focusing on the ends working towards the scalp. avoid actually putting any on your roots or your scalp to avoid weighing your hair down.  if there is not enough product, repeat again in tiny pea-sized increments.  style as usual.

i love this particular leave-in conditioner not only because it plays well with heat and dryers but also because it is equally effective at smoothing frizz without help.  i have combination eurasian hair: my mother's asian dead straight and fine hair plus my dad's curls so i end up with a somewhat frizzy messy-looking crop with its own mind.  my hair's personality varies with humidity and since products meant for curly hair weighs it down due to the straight bits and straight hair products just don;t cut it, i'm always in search of something in between that will work. this product seems to be the perfect solution to my combination hair woes. it leave my hair frizz-free and silky to touch without weighing it down.",2015-04-28,4,5,A2NUBL2UYWPBWR,B00103DUZS

my hair has a lot of natural curl and tends to get frizzy, especially when the humidity is high.
when i use just a few drops of this product distributed through my wet hair, it behaves and looks better whether i blow dry it or let it dry naturally.

my advice is to try much less than you think you need.  rub the drops in your hands and work it through your wet or damp hair.  so far i haven't made the mistake of applying too much and the tiny amount i've been using works very well to lessen the worst traits of my hair and seems to work well for heat styling or allowing it to dry curly on its own.",2015-04-28,4,5,A2G7B7FKP2O2PU,B00103DUZS

1948,"i was disappointed in how this cream performed based on the price i had to pay at the "cosmetic dermatologist's" office!
it was $68 for 1.7 oz of the revision nectifirm cream, and unfortunately i saw no difference in my neck what so ever!

i really, really wanted the nectifirm to work! i'm an otherwise young looking woman, and was horrified when my neck seemed to lose the elasticity it had previously had after i lost some weight. i have a small area between my chin and neck that i've tried everything on, but i suppose when the priorities in life are taken care of, if i still have that small problem area i can have some type of skin treatment.

anyway, my big complaint isn't with the cream, or the manufacturer, it's with the doctor! she sold me the cream, but didn't tell me you had to use it in a particular way! i just happened to be on youtube one day and happened to find a necktifirm video! they had a method for using the cream, and it was very specific. i was 1/2 way though the cream, and used the remainder the way it was prescribed in the video, but didn't feel i'd really know if i'd have had any better benefit if i'd have used the cream in the specified way the entire time.

even though i didn't know there was a process to using the cream, i had to assume i wouldn't have seen any further improvement with the first 1/2 jar, and just chalked it up to live and learn! i've tried many creams and lotions... i have no problems with them as long as they smell good and absorb well - in other words they don't just sit on top of my skin if they're supposed to soak in with their special "nanosphooses" or "hydrofloofers". if i'm paying more than drug store price for some newly discovered chemical complex or supposed stem cell therapy, i want to "see" a pleasant difference, as well as feel a nice difference!

the doctor told me this is the only cream that has been fda approved to lift and improve the skin tone of the aging neck. i don't know whether or not that's true, and i won't take her word for it, or base my review on what she's said.  i can only say that the cream had a very light pleasant scent and felt very nice, absorbing well and quickly. based on this i would recommend the cream, but based on lifting and firming of the neck, i can't recommend it.  i will continue to look, and would appreciate hearing about anyone else's experiences with products that do work really well on the neck for lifting and tightening the skin.",2014-01-18,2,5,A30638B9S2GOM8,B0010P6D28

i also like the white tea scent.  it's lightly floral and doesn't stick around leaving me smelling like sunscreen.

zero% zo mix with bunch of additives is hardly anything except chemicals. 97% organic with 18% zo, the best protection which costs few times less than coola with no chemicals. their mix is hardly organic and one needs to ask, do you really need to put fragrance on you skin when looking for protection from the sun as well as all other chemicals propanediol, sodium polyacryloyldimethyl taurate, sodium stearoyl glutamate, trideceth-10, trisodium ethylenediamine disuccinate, water, xanthan gum. the main ingredients are avobenzone and octinoxate, you can purchase that in mixes for tenth of the cost as coola.

zinc oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both uva (320-400 nm) and uvb (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light. chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks. zo is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions. non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts. zo must be non nano / uncoated ups -2 zo which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.

spf is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from uvb rays than someone wearing no cream. if the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes, for example, a person wearing spf15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer - 150 minutes. while uvb rays are behind the redness of sunburn, uva rays damage the skin's dna at a deeper layer. both radiation types can cause skin cancer. the eu recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a uva protection factor that is a third of their spf.

i make my own sunscreen as well as i purchase sunscreen for times when i do not have time to make any since i need to surf. for that reason, when i purchase a sunscreen mix, i need the same formula as i use when i make my own organic sunscreen mix since it only requires few ingredients but for more protection like my nose, i bump the zinc. zinc is what you see surfers put on their nose for protection. the more zinc, the more protection but it means a mix that is more like a mud since zinc is a powder that i purchase and add to evco. sunscreens are worse than processed foods (which i never consume) since there is no nutritional guide for sunscreens. for a small investment, sunscreens may offer me the possibility of avoiding sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc. that come with exposure to the sun. for that reason, choosing a formula with the least amount of ingredients but high zinc oxide is the best solution. a good sunscreen formula should not have more than a handful ingredients, certified organic at least 95% and free of; fragrances, biologically harmful chemicals like avobenzone, oxybenzone, or uv chemical absorbers, paraben, phthalates, paba and 1,4 dioxane.",2015-05-28,1,3,A2XKJ1KX6XUHYP,B00110S21M

the actual use is to apply it, but then cover it with a setting power or other foundation.  otherwise you have a green pallor about you.

in general, it works and conceals nicely.  it does not look or feel stick or cake up at all.  it is a very small tube, but it goes a looong way, so just the tiniest dab will work well.  i am just not enthralled with putting it on and then applying a setting powder or anything else.

2000,"i've heard very good things about this brand, and was excited to try this cleanser. i'm at the nuisance age of enjoying periodic acne along with mild wrinkles, so i keep looking for solutions for the former that don't exacerbate the latter (dry skin makes the wrinkles look worse, for those not yet familiar with the pattern). this cleanser is not going to stay in my arsenal.

pros:
1. only need to use a small amount, which should make the very small bottle last longer
2. rinses clean, without residue
3. doesn't aggravate my sensitive skin
4. doesn't seem to strip my skin, but leaves it feeling clean
5. doesn't dry my skin to make the wrinkles look worse

cons:
1. doesn't do much other than clean. i didn't notice any effect other than the mental one from the "cooling action" of the menthol. i got zero benefit from using this other than the "cleansing" part.
2. not suitable for removing makeup. this is definitely a cleanser to be used strictly for a makeup-free face. even when i used it after removing my makeup (with neutrogena wipes, which are the best i've found so far), i still needed another cleanser for traces of eye makeup since i'm not putting menthol around my eyes.
3. doesn't foam. it's more of a watery gel, like inexpensive liquid hand soap. that means it's also kind of runny, so applying it in the shower meant it ran into my eyes if i wasn't careful. note that this is only because i let it sit on my skin for several seconds to try to get some benefit from the salicylic acid. this approach is not suggested on the packaging, so i can't fault obagi for it. i do wish it had a thicker consistency, though, so the salicylic acid could sit and have time to do something.
4. expensive. considering the tiny bottle size and minimal effects (and the need for something else to remove makeup), the price tag seems very high. i've used drug store cleansers that were on par with this one for a fraction of the cost. if i'm spending more, i'd rather invest in algenist or la mer cleansers, which don't claim to do anything for acne, but do clean my skin beautifully (including eye makeup).

overall, i'm sad to say i can't recommend this cleanser.",2017-02-03,2,3,A1QXE7OX7MSL2H,B0013A6NFM
2001,"this is a tiny miracle bottle.  it contains salicylic acid which is a leader in skin care for blemishes.  it comes in a small bottle but a tiny drop lathers and goes a long way.  the smell is strong as if you can feel it working.  i think it is clearing my skin daily the more i use it.  recommended.",2017-02-03,5,5,A1DNXL8BIR5R8R,B0013A6NFM
2002,"i haven't seen an amazing change in my skin from using this cleanser for the past couple of weeks, but so far it does appear to be helping a bit with major breakouts, at least. i just can't imagine that it's worth the price point, especially as i'm a bit iffy about the scent and feel of the product. it has a surprisingly heavy floral scent when first applied, and then when it foams it has the tinge of menthol (which you can also feel on your skin). it's just a bit off-putting; i almost wish they didn't try to mask the product with that floral scent at all.",2017-02-03,3,5,AMCAID3LTHKEC,B0013A6NFM

(will it ever end?) i've found through the years that salicylic acid seems to be the product that helps my complexion the most. the obagi clenziderm contains 2% salicylic acid, which is the strongest version i've seen otc. it makes my face so clean and the menthol gives a cooling sensation. i won't use this daily because it can be a little drying. i will definitely use it a few times a week to keep my skin clear. it works fast. recommended",2017-02-03,5,5,A3091RP0SPZLMN,B0013A6NFM

(the key for me is to never wear makeup other than a little mascara and lipstick.)  (just try telling a 15 year old goth that.)

allow to dry or hit it with the hair dryer!
once dry feel free to shake your head over the sink to prove nothing is coming lose!

you're now good to go! yes, your hair will feel a little more crunchy than normal,but for me i didn't care. this saved me from a lot of embarrassment and i recommend it to at least try. i don't think it will cover a bald head unless you want to look like you glued hair sprinkles on,

2065,"i want to give an honest assessment because i know how hair loss affects each of us. i've been losing my hair since i was 20 and have done everything under the sun to fight it off. i've reached a point in my life, after some surgeries, where i've got about 30-40 percent density over the entire top of my head and a little less in the back. i have run out of donor hair and was stuck with either having to wear a hair system or use a masking product. when i first started using this i was prepared to give it a lower rating. it didn't seem to apply evenly and ran very easily with a little sweat or water. after applying it a dozen times it got easier and was more effective so don't necessarily give up after the first couple of tries.

first of all, toppik won't cover a completely bald head. you have to have some hair already for it to look even slightly natural. i hold the bottle about 2 inches off my head and tap the side of the bottle and move it around to try and apply it evenly. you should use bright lighting when you apply it and use a hand mirror so you can check the top of your head a few times as you're applying it. it makes your hair look very powdery at first so i lightly rub the top of my hair to get some of it to fall down into the scalp. then, and this is very important, you have to use a good shiny hair spray. i put 2-3 applications on to counteract the dull look from the toppik powder. the more hair you already have the easier this process is, and the more natural it will look. don't go swimming with it or stand out in a heavy rain shower for very long, or it will clump and/or run at some point as the hair spray wears off. i would encourage you to do at least 3-4 trial runs before going into public, and order a couple different colors to try. also, i sometimes use dermmatch (scalp concealer) as a first step to apply a base coat since it is even more water proof and is less expensive. then the toppik on top of it provides more texture. i use a lot of toppik on each application. a medium size bottle of it lasts me about 5-6 weeks applying it almost every day.",2016-02-29,4,5,AF3APPUEZ4WU4,B0013U0EYI

i attach the sprayer, cover my head in a fine mist, pat, comb. i continue to apply where needed and then spray with the fiber fix (or hairspray, if in a pinch, works fine). my hair is shiny and i am ready to face the world without being embarrassed about my mostly bald head. i now look like i have hair where there is none, or very little.

  i started purchasing from amazon and found the product more reasonably priced.  amazon also has a pump that screws onto the toppik bottle and you can direct the powder better to the areas where you need it most.  i use a little hair spray to help hold it in place.  i found the medium brown covers my scalp better than the light brown and blends better with my hair color and highlights.  i would be lost without this product.  one negative i don't think can be avoided, is the powder can make your hair look a little dull at the roots, but the alternative would be the appearance of  thinning hair.  i order the refills and re-use my container.",2015-06-07,5,5,A31M40X061BW0H,B0013U0EYI

2119,"i use this every day, but i also shower at night and "no-poo" my baby fine hair every few days. if you do not, then the fibers might get on your pillowcase.

with a new bottle, i peel off the plastic tape that is covering the shaker, then tape off 1/2 of the opening with blue painter's tape - otherwise too much will come out too fast.

you do not actually shake this on to your hair, but instead into your  part lines. part your hair, hold the bottle at 45 degrees or so, and gently tap the fibers into the part while holding your other hand over your forehead to keep fibers off from there. you may have to do a quick wipe of your forehead with a tissue. if you have a lot of fibers on your forehead, you are tapping too much and too hard - or you didn't seal off 50% of the shaker with painter's tape. it does not take a lot to make your hair look fuller, just a tap-tap-tap and them move on to the next area.

this would not work well for extensive baldness (nothing does!), but works well for the dreaded "wide part" problem. dark hair would be more of a challenge on a light-skinned person, as the contrast between hair and scalp would make the fibers show more than with medium brown hair.

they have a really small travel-size that i carry in my handbag, so you can try it without spending much $...you would not have to tape the shaker part on that one!

one suggestion for toppik company is to make the darn container transparent - it is completely opaque, so there is no way to know when you are running out, except to shake it in the sink. dumb, as people would order sooner, if they knew they were running low.",2014-11-06,5,3,A2PFKD76DMWIEF,B0013U0EYI

update 5/13/2017: i don't know when amazon increased their price but they need to reconsider! i had been buying it from amazon loyally but a $38 increase from the toppik website price is crazy! went to the company website and autosubscribed to get the same product for $71/month instead of the $115 amazon now charges. very disappointed.",2014-08-18,4,1,AIO1DYYJQVTP6,B0013U0EYI

i bought the attachment which at least gives some level of control. i would not buy this again. you'd get as much coverage putting a little brown eyeshadow on your head.",2013-07-29,3,2,A3POA5GUWACBD4,B0013U0EYI
2160,"i went through a major hair shed a couple of years ago, which was when i got my first toppik fibers. this product has helped preserve my vanity by hiding my widening part and other thin spots on my head. toppik blends in so nicely and stays put until your next wash. i don't use the spray nozzle attachment, i just sprinkle it on and pat it out to blend in, as they demonstrate in the video on toppik's website.

i've never seen residue on my clothing or pillowcase (however, fine dust does fly everywhere when applying it, so get dressed after application!). the stuff doesn't even bleed out after a tough, sweaty workout either. as far as the colors, after some trial and error, i mostly use medium brown, which is more of a dark than a golden brown shade. i've also tried light brown, but that shade is more of a dark ash blonde and i had to blend the medium and light to make it work. i ended up dyeing my hair a little darker so i can stick to the medium brown and keep things simple.

the only negative is that the fine dust settles on my white bathroom counters after application, but is easily cleaned up. right now amazon has the best price on this product, costing $10 less than at beauty supply stores. i've also tried caboki, which for me was of inferior quality, lasting power and had a funny rubber-like smell (toppik has no scent whatsoever).",2013-07-12,5,5,A1FDWNNQ50ATXS,B0013U0EYI

2162,"this stuff is great for thinning hair, but you need some hair for it to adhere to.  it's keratin, which i believe is a protein that is part of the structure of hair and it looks very natural, if you choose the right color.  even a hairdresser couldn't tell i was using it until she washed my hair.  it comes out easily with shampoo, but can last for a day or two if you don't wash your hair.  it makes your hair look so much thicker and that is saying something.  my hair is so thin in the back that my scalp shows through, but with toppik, you can't tell.  even if someone was sitting behind you, like in church, i don't think they would pick up on the fact that you are using it.  men, if your head is totally bald, you know, shiny, i don't think this is for you, but if you are thinning and still have a fair amount of strands of hair left, this could work for you.  be sure to get the color closest to the rest of your hair.  i believe they even have grey.  i use either the dark brown or the light brown depending on the shade that i have my hair dyed.  also, it doesn't come off on my pillow like the joan rivers junk, and the medium size can lasts pretty long. it's expensive, sort of, but worth it.  definitely cheaper than a wig or toupee.  as soon as i open a new container, i order another one, just to make sure that i never run out.  the best price i have found is on this website. sally's beauty supply is much more expensive, as is the toppik website.",2013-05-20,5,5,A2FP9UXBM2OBYI,B0013U0EYI
2163,"works great to hide thinning hair patches. just shake on the areas that are thinning. works by concealing balding scalp areas - the micro fibers lay on top of your scalp darkening the area so your otherwise shiny noggin doesn't show thru the thinning hair. also somewhat thickens the appearance of hair. withstands wind pretty well & moisture to some degree. washes out easily with shampoo and water. will also rub off on your hands if you run your hands thru your hair. is purely a cosmetic fix to hiding hair loss. for it to work well, it's necessary for there to be some hair, even if it is fine and short, present to which the fibers can adhere and fill in. best for concealing small patches. causes me no irritation and don't even know i'm using it.

it helps to apply a fine hairspray to keep toppik topic in place, but i rarely need to do this. if i do, i use a tresemme extra fine mist spray. the scent is mild and doesn't leave you with old lady aquanet smelling helmet hair. you can use any hairspray you like - consort, american crew, etc.

to get the best control over where the fibers go, it's best to hold the can as close to the head as possible and ever so lightly aggitate the can to shake just enough and where you want it. there is no reason to hold it high above the head - in fact, if you do, fiber will go every which way and may go where its not needed. they make a special applicator for the can to "spray" the fiber, but i find it more efficient to just apply keeping the regular can shaker top close to the head. for the front close to the hairline, it's best to apply back away from the hairline at first and let the fibers naturally fall forward as needed. if you apply too close to the hairline, it may look too fake. you can always come a bit closer and apply.

works well for men and women alike. has no scent.

get the color that best matches your hair color. you can use 2 different colors if you are looking for a special match, but i find the dark brown works just find for my typical dark brown hair.

i'm a 40 yr old guy with thinning hair, but i still want to wear a pomp. fortunately, i just have some thinning patches and not extensive balding such as mpb on top. toppik works for me even if i use pomade to get the pomp look i like. i apply toppik after greasing up and getting my hair partially styled. i'll add toppik as needed to the thinning spots as i comb and style. the pomade actually seems to help keep toppik adhering better and covers my thinning patches well. i've found that using a water based pomade as a base works best and then using a petrolatum/wax based pomade as a topper for shine really helps. i add the toppik after applying pomades. you can add more pomade if you need to, but i usually then need to add a bit more toppik since some will inevitably come out on your hands when applying pomade to hair that already has toppik applied.

the stuff is not waterproof and will come out if you get your head soaked.

face it guys, there's no miracle cure for hairloss - yet. toppix is a good cosmetic choice for hiding hairloss, but if you're bald or otherwise don't have at least some hair to which toppix can blend into, this may not work for you. you can always buy one of the smaller sizes to try out if unsure.",2013-05-01,5,5,A1FEI4HDXTA454,B0013U0EYI

2167,"purchased for my elderly mother who constantly laments her thinning hairline. although this is obviously a superficial solution, it does make her feel like she has more hair in front. a little tricky to apply (it is a fine powder, afterall), and tends to get all over the place. but used judiciously, desired results can be achieved with some practice. not sure if she will repurchase, but at least for now it offers an easy solution for bald spots. it basically just colors your scalp like shoe polish, doesn't really thicken fine hair as claims.",2013-04-06,4,3,A3QXLSQVR1RX5M,B0013U0EYI
2168,"my hair dresser told me about toppik's hair building fibers because one of her clients has had success using it.  toppik is intended to make your scalp appear as if it has hair in the right places.  this illusion is created by the tiny keratin particles bonding to your own hair.  if your scalp is actually bald and there is no hair that is combed over it, this product isn't going to work for you.  that said, it does wonders for those of us with thinning hair.  just be sure to get the correct color that matches your own.  for example, the light blonde is strictly for those with very light, platinum blonde hair.  if your hair has the least bit of ash or red tone in it, opt for the medium blonde toppik.

after you have dried your hair (using all of the products you normally apply), sprinkle the toppik onto the areas that need to look fuller.  lightly tap the area to help the keratin particles `grasp' the hair.  once you have filled in these spaces, you may lightly style your hair.  vigorous brushing will remove toppik so, don't do it.  toppik should remain in place until you brush or shampoo.
applying toppik is fairly simple.  begin by sprinkling it a little at a time until you see the desired effect.  if you are placing it near your hairline, toppik offers a tool for putting it in a small, defined area.  (i just hold a tissue on my face to avoid having it settle on my skin.)  the top of the jar is wide so, if you want to cover a very small area, the tool could be quite handy.

for even greater results, i recommend toppik's hair fattener.  this is a leave-in treatment.  the results i have with it are impressive.  it works by making the hair appear a little thicker.  i have been using it for about six weeks and even my husband can see a small difference in the thickness of my hair.  (toppik's claim is that continued use will make a permanent change in the thickness of the hair.) using both products together will really help you look like you have no gaps of hair.

i still use another product (a colored powder) that i brush onto my scalp to help cover the sparser areas in front.  but, i use far less of it with toppik's products.

2179,"i ordered my first can of toppick hair building fibers based on the mostly good reviews by other users.  i agree that this is a good product.  it's not great, it doesn't make me suddenly look like i have lots of hair, but i must say that it is better than the hair i "naturally" have now.  apparently due to aging, my once very thick hair has thinned drasically in the past ten years, and i have tried many, many products in an effort to either regrow hair, or to give the illusion of more hair.  toppick is applied after shampooing, drying and styling, and on top of any other hair thickening products.  it is a fine powder that is manually shaken from the can. toppick is sold in several different color shades and "light brown" is the first shade that i tried, as i have light brown hair with blond highlights, neither of which are my natural shade.  after the first few shakes, i discovered that there were more hair building fibers all over my shoulders, shirt and the bathroom than on my head.  i invested in the applicator made to fit over the top of the can and i urge anyone who is interested in trying toppick, to do the same.  the nozzle-tip applicator makes it much easier and neater to apply this product.  the major plusses of toppick are that it hides my shiny pink scalp and i find that the fibers do give the illusion of more hair.  the minuses include:  1.  i need to use a lot of toppick to achieve the desired results, making this product more expensive than i thought it would be; 2.  i need to use a special "spray" to get the fibers to stick in place, adding another expense; 3.  any time i comb or "fix" my hair during the day, the toppick fibers come out, so i need to reapply which is not easily accomplished when not at home; and 4.  the powder texture dulls the look of my hair.
  since the minuses are greater than the plusses, for me, i gave the toppick hair building fibers, light brown, only 3 stars.  will i continue to use this product?  absolutely - i haven't found anything else that hides my "naked" scalp and gives even a slight illusion of more hair as well as as the toppick fibers.  will i continue to use rogaine as well as other thickening and volume building products?  absolutely - at least until a magic potion is developed to successfully regrow hair, or my vanity weakens.  if you are a mature woman and your crowning glory has been reduced to just a few strands, i would highly recommend that you give toppick a try, just don't make your expecttions too high.",2012-05-28,3,3,A2WFZWRYWLC20S,B0013U0EYI

i'm an african american male with thinning hair on the sides as well as top due to over processing my hair as a youth. it makes it difficult to get a nice even haircut and i can't where the low to bald styles since i have acne keloiditis around the rear hairline which causes hair loss and unattractive keloids. it's so embarrassing that i don't even like for people to stand behind me on the elevator. one day i discovered toppik and although no one in the videos had my type of hair i thought what the hell, it's worth a try.

toppik has completely changed my life. it's not perfect but look at it like makeup. it covers up just enough so that if you didn't tell people they wouldn't know. i have confided in 2 or 3 close friends that i started using it and asked if they saw any difference. they said "that stuff is f--- amazing!" if you have thinning or balding hair, scalp issues to cover up it's worth the money.

it's not gonna stay on overnight. it's not going to stay put on the sides or back under a hat. i've even tried holding spray and it will work but i personally have to gel my hair so hard that it's not favorable all the time. those are the only downsides. take it from me and my friends..it works and its amazing :)",2010-06-06,5,5,A2HVR0MZAO14S6,B0013U0EYI
2186,"i've waited a bit to write this review.  i've got a good size bald/thinning spot on the crown of my head.  a couple of months ago i decided to try toppik after my barber recommended it.  it has taken a while to get the routine down and learn to apply it just right.  i've been very happy but yesterday proved to me what a great product this is.  i never told anyone what i was doing.  people kept asking me if i had just gotten a haircut.  they knew something had changd, but couldn't figure out what it was.

yesterday i was out for a walk qith my partner of 30 years and a friend.  while i was walking in front of them my partner said "what did you do to your hair?"  i cringed.  i thought that he had noticed that i had put something on it and it showed.  i aksed him what he meant.  he said that my bald spot was gone.  he then got right up on top of me and looked at my hair.  he could not tell what i had done, but my bald spot was gone.  my friend touched it and said that it was soft.  if i could fool them i could fool anyone.  even looking for it they couldn't tell.

like i said, it took a bit to get the application down just right.  this should not discourage you, you just need a little practice. i wash my hair, blow dry it and apply the toppik, using a hand mirror to see the back.  i use the toppik until i get good coverage, brush it and then use a light spray of tresseme hairspray.  it kind of seals it on the hair and keeps everything in place, but it is not stiff.  most days this is just a minute or so.  you don't need to blowdry if you just let your hair dry naturally, but don't use the toppik on wet hair.  i think that it would clump.  also the blow dryer give the hair a bit of volume which helps.

2188,"i'm in my early 30's and have a receding hairline. you ever sleep with hairspray on your hair and to wake up next morning with linty hair? that's exactly how i would describe the texture when you use this on your hair. i purchased color black with the pump sprayer, pick/comb, and their hairspray. i accidently sprayed the toppik powder onto my scalp and noticed the toppik color was more like dark purple. it takes a while to perfect the use of the pump to get the right amount of toppik sprayed only onto the hair. no matter how perfect your results come out, up real close you can notice something different and i'm sure under the direct sunlight it's probably 10x more noticeable. toppik claims that people can't even notice 2 inches away, that's bull. this is definitely a better product than couvre the scalp concealer. toppik hairspray is like any other strong hold hairspray, absolutely nothing advanced or special about it. the comb is a piece of crap, made out of cheap paper/plastic not even worth a quarter! go to a dollar store and find yourself a better comb. toppik comes off easily so avoid moisture even your sweat, wind, and any objects & elements disrupting the do. the money and the time you have to spend to get a half decent look in my honest opinion is not worth it. i rather deal with a wearing a hat then worrying about an embarrassing toppik malfunction. maybe if you're in your 60's and not as concerned about the natural look then more power to you, but i still think people are over paying for a product that doesn't promise what they claim. i'm currently trying a product called nuhair. i'm taking the vitamin and using their hair serum. i'm only on the second month and hoping to see some results within the next few months. there are no cheap quick fixes that lasts forever so i'm going to commit to this nuhair program for 5-6 months and hope for the best. figure hair transplant takes up to 6 months anyways so might as well give the natural method a 6 month commitment. if the natural way fails then rogaine is a possibility and then hair transplant. bottom line, my girlfriend thinks i wasted my money on this product (toppik) and i'm going to have to agree with her on this. hope you guys learn from my mistake. if you guys know of any good hair transplant doctors in the bay area ca let me know. good luck fellas.",2009-04-13,2,1,A2XKRIJKX4HF8N,B0013U0EYI

right now i have oily combination skin, but mostly oily on t zone and cheeks. i decided to get the regimen kit by this company, and in it is a sample of this product.

i cleaned my face and used the toner, then tried this item. i loved it instantly. it goes on so smoothly and easily. you only need a tiny bit, even my sample will last a week or two with how little i need to use. it sinks in my skin and leaves me with a nice velvety finish.

the next morning i woke up to smooth skin! no oil! i was so blown away. i went and purchased the normal size. it's pricy, i never usually spend more than $7 on a product so this is new to me. but i want to take my skincare seriously and will make the investment. also, i got another free sample of this cream with my full size purchase from ulta.",2014-02-06,5,5,APYKGTU0LFICH,B0015Z90NC

not only does it clean well without overly stripping your skin, but it has a gentle exfoliation with the seaweed bits.  it's soothed my skin and made it glow in a way it hasn't in a while.

the only caveat i have with this product is that you must remove your makeup for it to be at its best.  most do anyway but sometimes i'm lazy and just do a double cleanse with my previous cleanser.  with this one it's best if you get everything off first but other than that it's really wonderful.

if you are looking for the tight/burning feeling that some cleansers leave you with (which isn't good for your skin!) this isn't your kind of cleanser.",2016-10-07,4,5,A34T6SD5HUGLCJ,B0015ZC1CY

made for all skin types.  this product is made in the usa.

the only thing i really don't like is the packaging.  a screw-cap bottle is not the way to go.  it probably would have been best to use a tube for this product.  ill have to keep the bottle turned upside-down to be able to get it out.",2016-09-19,4,3,AVU1ILDDYW301,B0015ZC1CY
2281,"i am a fan of mario badescu products.  i have recommended them to clients with skin sensitivities and in most cases they have been very happy with their performance.  once in a while, however, i come across a product which i am not as fond of.  this, unfortunately, happens to be one of them.

what is this cleanser like?
a nice sized bottle, i do like the color of the cleanser.  it reminds me of pistachio ice cream.  the texture of the cleanser is very creamy and thick.  it has tiny flecks of dark green in it which is the seaweed.  the fragrance is a touch overwhelming for me, however.  i am not sure what it is.  it just is not a smell that i enjoy a whole lot.  the label stays on and does not come off like&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/mario-badescu-the-moisture-magnet-spf-15-2-oz/dp/b0015z532o/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8">mario badescu the moisture magnet spf 15, 2 oz.</a>.

how does this cleansing soap perform?
a little goes  along way of this stuff.  it is thick and creamy and a delightful green color.  the cream smears around on the skin nicely and when adding a little bit of water to it, it does foam up some, but is not really sudsy like some soaps can be.  it does make skin soft at first, but then i feel as if the skin is too stripped.  the time that i am testing this in is a time of humidity and more oiliness and this cleanser is stripping my skin already- in winter, i am thinking it will be way too much for me to use.  i have normal to dry skin.

i have had my daughter test it.  she said it was nice at first but felt it stripped her skin a bit too much.

in both cases, the skin surface felt smooth, although dry and tight.

i have not had the men try it yet- they don't like to try new products. it is hard to pin them down.

the worst part- itching
the worst part about this cleanser is that it made our skin itch a bit.  perhaps it was from drying it out so much or maybe the sodium laureth sulfate it contains, but it just makes the skin feel uncomfortable.  no matter how much lotion i apply, it does not seem to soothe this feeling entirely.

the bottom line
great sized bottle, lovely texture and green color, this soap seemed promising.  creamy and easy to use without being overly foamy, i found the fragrance to be a bit overwhelming and it left our skin stripped and a bit itchy and uncomfortable and tight.

i have given this one star.  if you have very oily skin and perhaps don't mind it being a strong cleanser, then perhaps you would like it.  for us, it really is rough on our skin and it just leaves us too uncomfortable to rate it higher than that.",2016-09-14,1,3,AWIF8AR75LL9L,B0015ZC1CY
2282,"i have purchased mario badescu products in the past.

this seaweed cleansing soap, i didn't like the scent, i felt like i was putting a salad on my face, which i didn't like the little pieces in the cleansing soap, plus it really left my skin feeling clean, but overly clean, stripped, not feeling soft.

they say on the bottle that it's suitable for all skin types, which is kind of subjective to me.  yes i want my face to feel clean when iam using a cleansing product, but i don't like it feeling stripped. this also left my facial skin looking red, which really surprised me.  not sure if iam allergic to an ingredient in it or not.

2285,"i am a man who will soon be turning fifty-three.  during the past year, my skin has become dry, irritated and red.  to my chagrin, i had to stop using an electric shaver; this helped but i still had some patches of dry skin in areas where i didn't shave, primarily around my left eyebrow.  in order to relieve the situation, i had to shave every other day and only wash my face in the morning and never at night.  every morning, i used an exfoliator that was designed to be gentle (nivea men sensitive face wash).  still, i had to use a lot of cetaphil in order to relieve my dry skin.

  when the amazon vine program offered me the mario badescu seaweed cleansing soap, i jumped at the opportunity to try it.  it has noticeably improved the feel and texture of my skin.  i have returned to shaving every day and to washing my face twice a day, once in the morning and once at night before going to bed.  in fact, i feel confident that i could wash it more often as needed.  i squeeze a tiny smear of the greenish, speckled cream onto the palm of my left hand and use my right fingers to smear it onto my face.  i gently rub it into my skin.  the seaweed cleansing soap has a pleasant smell that is barely noticeable.  it is not strong and abrasive like liquid aftershave.

  the soap is easily washed off.  it does not sting my flesh like some exfoliators have done.  my skin is left feeling moist, not dry and irritated.  according to the packaging, this soap is designed for all skin types.  the plastic bottles appearance is neither feminine nor masculine.  it is what i call gender friendly.  however, there wasn't any safety seal beneath the old-fashioned screw on cap.  it is difficult to rub a small amount into the palm of my hand.  it would have been better if the cap had a spout that lies flat with the top of the bottle.  you lift up the spout and squeeze out a small dollop of the cream.

  overall, i really like the seaweed cleansing soap from mario badescu skincare.  it thoroughly cleans my skin, giving it a healthy glow, without dehydrating it.  i relish the creamy texture, color and scent of the cleanser.  it easily washes off my face.  the bottle is small enough to carry in a backpack, purse, shoulder bag, tote bag, etc.  therefore, it is conducive for traveling.  after using the product for nearly a week, i haven't experienced any adverse side effects.  i highly recommend this seaweed cleansing soap.  it would make a thoughtful present for someone with a troubled complexion.",2016-09-08,5,5,A244CRJ2QSVLZ4,B0015ZC1CY

2312,"let me start by saying i really hate eye creams.  hate them passionately.  my eyes are super sensitive, plus i wear contacts so many creams and serums seem to cause issues for me and i end up buying items that i use maybe 3 times before tossing out.  what a waste of money.  unfortunately, my eye area tends to be very dry and sadly, there are some lines and crepe-y texture trying to happen, so i keep trying to find the holy grail of eye creams...and i think this might actually be it!  i started using this just under a week ago, and upon application, didn't think i was going to like it.  it is very emollient, and didn't immediately absorb into my skin.  fine for night time (because it's completely absorbed in the morning) but not so great for daytime, i thought.  i forged ahead anyway, lightly blotted the area with tissue and applied my concealer.  it plays very nicely with it, and it makes the area look smooth and fresh, with out causing creasing or smearing.  i was pleasantly surprised!

after using this religiously morning and night, i can honestly say i'm seeing results.  not only does the skin under my eyes look better, it feels better, firmer, smoother, less crepe like and more like a baby's bottom.  the fine lines look softer already, so i'm excited to see what results continued use will provide me.  there's been no irritation, no eye swelling or puffiness that a lot of creams have given me, and no issues with the cream traveling up into my eyes and ruining a pair of contacts.

i do use this over my hyaluronic acid serum and am certain that it's helping to bind the moisture of this cream to my skin that much better, and maybe it's the combination of these two products that are giving me such dramatic, rapid results, but honestly, this is one of the very best eye creams i've ever tried and i have tried a lot.  from the obscenely expensive to the cheap as they come variety, this one has them beat, hands down.  i seriously love this eye cream, and as someone who generally despises them, that's saying a lot!",2015-05-30,5,5,A2RKTFRM6YRK1D,B0015ZAOGO

2322,"based on reading another review, i went to mario badescue's website and did their skin analysis.  you answer some questions and they give you product recommendations.  i had already received this moisturizer for review, but had not tried it yet.  this moisturizer was not the one recommended so i was a little nervous at the term "moisture magnet."  i have combination skin and have a hard time finding moisturizers that don't make me breakout. even if i find one that works for a while eventually it makes my skin breakout.  i usually don't use a moisturizer just to avoid the drama.

the first time i tried it, i put it on my arms.  it has a slight pleasant scent to it.  i just use a little dab ( see picture) and it goes a long way.  my dog came over to me and tried to lick my arms lol so i guess it's a good scent to him too lol.  the scent dissipates after a momment. when my skin stayed normal the next day, i tried it on my face before i went to bed.  i woke up the next morning, and no new breakouts!  i already had 2 breakouts from getting my face waxed ( i went to a new salon and something they used on my face after waxing to calm the redness made me breakout). both the breakouts were visibly reduced.  my skin feels soft. my forehead was a little shiny the first day so i've decided to use the moisturizer once a day for now to see how my skin reacts.  as this product has sod in it i decided to use during the day.  so far so good once a day use.

i recommend using the skin analysis. i am going to receive free samples from mario badescue's  website of the products they recommend for my skin, so i can test out the moisturizer they recommend in comparison to this one i received to see which is the best for my skin.  either way i am sticking with a moisturizer from their line.  the cool thing is they don't have a one size fits all moisturizer like most companies, so you have freedom to choose which one works best for you. this is my first experience with the company, and it was a good one. i recommend trying their products.

update: this moisturizer still works great after using a few weeks.  i've also noticed a decrease in the fine lines that were starting to form on my face without using my normal age defying product of which i had run out recently.  i guess my skin was drier than i thought before using this product, and maybe that was what was causing the lines.  i'm happy to be saving money by only needing one product.  i will definitely buy in the future.

2332,"mario badescu fan for a long time.  several years ago i entered all the magical things i was looking for in a facial cleanser, again and again mario badescu kept popping up.  since then i keep coming back to mario badescu when i need results.

i am in my late 30s, i have combination skin, i have super dry skin around my eyes, oily around my nose, and the rest of my face changes moisture levels frequently.  i still get acne, i have gigantic pores and am prone to blackheads.  my skin is also extremely sensitive.  i can't handle harsh cleansers or heavy fragrances, and certain chemicals - my face gets red, it feels hot, and i can't stand my own skin.

my current cleansing habit as we approach the change in seasons is to use raw honey to clean my face, sometimes using adzuki beans to slough off dead skin.  after cleansing i use rose water to tone or remove eye makeup.  i was also using mario badescu rose hip oil around my super dry eyes.  i sometimes use barbussa oil or natural shea butter to moisturize - but as long as the weather is above 60 degrees these melt and sort of roll off my face, so i need a back up plan.  there is little to no scent in the moisture magnet.  the lotion is not terribly thick and it isn't runny, it is a medium consistency.  after my toner, i put a little rose hip oil around my eyes, and then a pea sized amount of the moisture magnet on the rest of my face.  the top has a small spout to deliver just the right amount of moisturizer in your hand, the bottle is a squeeze bottle.  i sometimes find with moisturizers that my oily regions get sort of slick with an all over moisturizer, i don't have that problem with the moisture magnet.  this keeps my face dewy and plump, but not oily or greasy.  the other thing i really worry about with moisturizers is clogging pores, since mine are huge, my pores do not seem to be any more plugged up than with the usual amount of dirt on the day to day.  i also can get cystic acne with some moisturizers, i have been using this for several weeks now and have not had a cystic acne breakout.

all in all, this works well for my skin type.  i do not have a lot of wrinkles or fine lines on my face, so i would not be able to accurately tell you if this helps with anti aging.  the spf works pretty well, i work outside a lot of the time, and i have yet to get a sunburn on my face.",2016-09-14,5,5,A89ZZKNDFQH23,B0015Z532O

2337,"i am a makeup artist.  i have had a lot of experience using a wide spectrum of moisturizing and skin care products.  i have also been developing my own personal skin care from natural ingredients this past year for me to use with really good results so far.  skin care is one of my many passions.

what is this stuff like?
mario badescu moisture magnet is something that i was very interested to try because i have recommended this line to several people that i know who have extremely sensitive skin with a lot of problems such as eczema, rosacea, and random skin problems that limit them in what they can use on their skin.  they are not willing or able to use diet to control their skin problems (very effective) and they still need to use something.

this product is a light peachy pink in color.  it comes in a flip top bottle which is soft, so easy to squeeze out.  the label on it is a bit of a problem as it is supposed to be peeled away in two levels to read the inside for instructions.  the label was very hard to get apart, and ended up having the clear coating peel away instead, which means that the label now will not go back into place.  this is very annoying.

the cream is very thick- almost too thick- and a little goes a long way. there is no scent- very little if any.

how does this perform?
well, this product claims to be a moisture magnet and sunscreen.  it definitely does as promised.  i found that when applying this to the skin, it definitely does moisturize and keep it moisturized throughout the day.  i am testing this in the summer, however, so i will also use this in the dead of winter when skin gets very dry and see how it works.

as for sunscreen, it also does work, if that is what you are looking for.  i am not a big fan of this type of sunscreen, but i knew that this had it when i got it, so that is not an issue in my rating.

the texture of this does make a nice platform for foundation and makeup.  it does smooth the skin some (dimethicone to thank for that) and acts as a sort of primer as well as moisturizer, making it appropriate for applying makeup over.

is it natural?
for those of you looking for a more natural skin care line, this is more on the natural side, but it still has dimethicone, mineral oil, and some extracts of things which i don't consider natural, but for shelf life are more in line with long term performance.  the sunscreen in it is not one that i really like but it does the job if that is your primary concern.

a word about sunscreen (caution)
i want to point out to you something that i consider very important.  have you ever seen someone on tv who has a face that looks ashen or gray?  have you ever seen someone in a photo whose hands look peachy pink, or beautiful chocolate brown, yet their face looks like they have ashy dirty makeup on?

the culprit in those cases is sunscreen.  if you use a product with sunscreen in it, you will get flashback in photos, and have an ashy appearance in certain lights and on videos.  your skin on your face will look starkly different than the rest of your body, even under makeup.

if you are going to use this, i would suggest that you avoid using it for special occasions when you know you will have photos taken that really matter to you or video that has bright intense light because you might be disappointed.  i am not sure if this company makes a version without sunscreen or not, but that would be a better choice for those special occasions where photos and video will be an issue.

the bottom line
this product does what it says.  it keeps skin moisturized throughout an entire day.  it keeps the skin protected from the sun even under makeup.  there are not annoying scents or any bad reactions that i have had from using this moisturizer.  my only frustration with it is the label coming apart in a way that it will not go back together, making it frustrating to store.  i took one star off for that.  using tape is what i am doing, but it still is making it tough to work with.  i would prefer a different style of labeling.  perhaps a box with an insert and only key ingredients on the bottle or something else?

four stars at this point, and i will update when winter comes as performance will be completely different when the air is dry and skin is parched.",2016-09-11,4,4,AWIF8AR75LL9L,B0015Z532O
2338,"i put this on in the morning and didn't put on any makeup since i planned on staying home.  my skin felt soft all day, but also just a tad greasy.  after washing my face before bedtime, i applied this and wore it to bed.  my skin felt well hydrated in the morning.  i will continue to use this product and post any new results.

2346,"this is a modest portion of body lotion which touts a variety of beneficial natural ingredients. i'm rating it based on usability and effectiveness as well as consider value. first, i will address effectiveness and say that i found this to be a better than average cream for dry, scaly skin (especially hands). it softened well and made my hands feel smooth for a longer period of time than other consumer-grade lotions like lubriderm. it didn't function as well as some prescription lotions, but it is more accessible.

in terms of usability, it does have a unique scent - an almost clinical one which isn't really medicinal, but has the smell of chemicals or unusual flowers with a not entirely pleasant smell. the scent is better than some overly perfume-like lotions, but it still isn't great. the texture is thick and creamy and it spreads well, though it does initially leave a bit of a tacky feeling, but absorbs after about 15 minutes and no longer feels tacky. it's an effective lotion and you can use it in smaller amounts so the higher price tag isn't such a big deal, but it still is a factor in considering the product's value if you need to use it on more of your body than just your hands.",2016-09-11,4,4,A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV,B00172BJ7I

2359,"today was my lucky day.  last week i went to a dermatologist for the first time in my life.  he wasted no time in telling me what he saw and out the door he went.  what he said was mostly good....like the skin on my face was in great shape and condition for my age, but i certainly hadn't paid the same attention to my back, legs and arms.  on this, he stated i really needed to get a good moisturizer for my body, preferably one with vitamin e in it.  i figured i had enough bottles of lotion at home i could use and could wait until i'd used them all up before buying something else.

so, for eight or nine days, i lathered on the lotions and creams i had.  i still had itching problems on my back and name of my neck.  today, this
mario badescu vitamin e body lotion arrives and i grabbed my applicator and slathered it on my back, legs and arms.  that was early today and now it is 9:45 pm and i am not scratching my skin at all.

now, it's difficult to make a good review by using it just one day but i had to tell someone that my skin certainly does feel better.  but, i am going to use up this bottle and if my skin still feels moisturized and itch-free, i'll stand by this review.  if not, i'm going to come back and tell you it's not as fantastic as i thought.  but right now i am going to go back and see what other products are made by badescu as this was my first experience with one of their products and i am impressed.  i won't be surprised if i never have to come back and tell you anything other than what i said above....it worked today and i am happy.",2016-08-31,5,5,A368H9GFY1JCYC,B00172BJ7I

i do not notice that my face broke out, which is a good sign.

this bottle is very small, and there are other ingredients fillers in this besides the rose hips.
not sure its worth the money !!!

the oil is intended to reduce flaky and dry skin.  the way to use it is to use a couple of drops and massage them into skin prior to applying your usual moisturizer.

the product doesn't remain sticky or heavy. it is absorbed quickly and doesn't leave skin looking shiny or oily.

after reading the ingredient list, i realized like others that this product really isn't an oil but a rose hip extract in a base of propylene glycol and glycerin.  even so, i do notice a benefit from using it as directed.  skin is less dry with a more even complexion.

(i also spray rose water on my hair). i pat my face dry, then i apply the rose hips nourishing oil, i tend to get very dry on the skin around my eyes.  i follow up with a moisturizing lotion.  i just love how fresh and dewy my face feels without being greasy or oily.  i really love it.

the skin around my eyes is so plump and healthy.  i also recently rubbed this on the heels of my feet after i walked barefoot in my yard one afternoon.  i did a foot soak, i gently rubbed my heels with a cloth, and then i put a bit of oil on each and rubbed them in.  it worked a mini miracle on my dragon scale feet.",2016-09-10,5,5,A89ZZKNDFQH23,B00172JYM0

she found that the nourishing oil was not oily on the skin. her skin just felt softer and not dry. it soaked right in and gave a skin the nice smooth non-dry appearance and feeling. it has no fragrance and it seems to leave no residue of any kind. another thing that she liked about the oil was that it was not a chemical soup. she will not use most of the common products for skin care because of the many unpronounceable substances which they contain.

obviously, the efficacy of a product like this is something one can ascertain accurately only over the course of months.  but the initial impression/first few uses can also make or break the 'beautiful relationship.'

this bottle will last forever. use it after washing your face, but before your nighttime moisturizer. that will lock in the vitamin c goodness and give it a real chance to do some good work on yoiur skin. don't be surprised if after a few weeks people are complimenting you on your glowy, radiant complexion!",2016-09-06,5,5,A2JCJJNY43QQIV,B00172JYM0

2429,"i like this serum, and notice a definate difference in the skin on top of my hands, which was starting to look crepey.  i've tried it on top of moisturizer and on it's own.  for me - it's too much in the hot humid climate i live in to have both a sunscreen moisturizer on and this product during the day.  although i used the serum sparingly, it still felt sticky and tacky and i had to wash it off after an hour or so.  however, i do use it at night over my moisturizer with no problems. i do notice that the fine lines on neck and mouth are softened.  as i said, i also use it on the thin skin on my hands and have noticed a big difference, much more than using the hand cream alone. there is no odor to this product that i can detect.

there is a con though.  the name is misleading calling it an 'herbal' hydrating serum.  i took this to mean it was a more natural product with more herbs, herb distillations in it.  here is the ingredient list:aqua (water,eau),glycerin,propylene glycol,dimethicone,carbomer,gingko biloba leaf extract,panax ginseng root extract,triethanolamine,dimethiconol,caprylyl glycol,cyclopentasiloxane,ethylhexyl cocate,hexylene glycol,sodium chloride,phenyl trimethicone,glycolipids, lecithin,phenoxyethanol,ci 42090 (blue 1),ci 19140 (yellow 5)
if you look them all up - the majority are man made silicones - a product which in the cosmetic industry is used to fill in wrinkles, retain moisture etc.  is this 'bad' for you?  you have to decide.  most are gras "generally recognized as safe"  for use in food and cosmetics.  if you use the ewg website, some are use with caution.

though not really an oil (an extract), it did help combat dry skin in the facial area.

this product is formulated with ginkgo extract, ceramides and panax ginseng for a generally beneficial skin tonic.

living in a hot, humid climate, this product arrived in my mailbox in a very warm state.  as such it was very thin and has remained that way.

one treatment of this does smooth fine lines and wrinkles and has an added moisturizing effect.

the way i use it is over my moisturizer.  it does not stay sticky and does not make skin appear oily or shiny.

i am new to the mario badescu line but am impressed by this product and its benefits.  it does not cause any irritation and i have very sensitive skin.  i would recommend it.",2016-09-13,5,5,A1BK60GZ4QME6I,B00172LM8O

2435,"i love this serum and i already use a number of excellent serums.  the serum is thicker than most, which allows the ginseng, ceramides and ginkgo  to penetrate.  on hot nights i even use it by itself as a moisturizer.  my only problem is with the artificial color.  i was hoping the color was from chamazuline from chamomile. but alas it is artificial ,ci 42090 (blue 1)...

this means that it might be inappropriate for women with sensitive skin.  i already see ingredients that my daughter in law must avoid. the gel is basically all artificial- when aloe or seaweed extracts could have done the job. i probably should knock it down a star but it works for me. i have no problem with the fragrance- it is pleasant and unobtrusive.",2016-09-10,5,4,A100ZQDV7L8PVV,B00172LM8O

i used to use mario badescu spray earlier but that made my face too shiny. this works better. it contains water and glycerin with some herbal ingredients to hydrate and protect the face. it's a bit expensive so i am rating it 4 stars.",2016-09-05,4,4,A6VPK7X53QNAQ,B00172LM8O

it does, however, reduce the fine lines in one treatment.  as long as it is on, the lines are for sure, softened.  and that is a real positive.

2444,"this is an expensive product, but i believe it is worth every penny.  i have never heard of a product layering over moisturizer.  this serum is very thick and comes out of a decent sized bottle made of plastic.  the opening is very narrow as to not over-dispense.

 i have trouble with moisturizer disappearing into my skin. i washed my face, toned it, put moisturizer and applied this product.  i felt it was too much so i started over. i didn't want to be sticky and this time i took small amounts and applied them to dryer areas.  i apply more to my under eye area and checks.  this is when i noticed that my creepiness has dissipated quite a bit.  i am 61 with pretty good skin, but because i have a cpap mask on every night it is starting to pull at my areas between under eyes and cheeks.

i do feel like this product is an asset, and i am glad someone thought of it.  you might find it sticky, but after awhile it is more matte.  this also depends of course upon what type of conditioner we use.  mime is not oily.  a more creamy or oily moisturizer will change the stickiness most likely quite a bit to more creamy.

2493,"people in the u.k. have made this the number one moisturizing cream in the country, and i can see why. i purchased a try me trio of products, and am so very pleased with all of them. the scent of all of the products i have tried is fresh and clean. if this scent was made into a day parfume it would sell out.

marine creams are all the rage, and this gel-to-cream formulation, helps to moisturize my skin.  antiaging ingredients help improve the look of my skin while helping to reduce lines. i  never miss a day without a moisturizer and this one is light enough to apply under my makeup or to wear just by itself. this is top of the line and top quality. this is both light and non-greasy. the pro-collagen marine cream is formulated with marine algae, padina pavonica, porphyridium, and ginkgo biloba.

i use this every morning. i apply a pea-size amount into my hands, and gently smooth over my face and  neck. my face feels much smoother and softer. i have not noticed any difference in my wrinkles or lines. this product is expensive, but well worth the money. only a very small amount is needed. however, don't purchase this size, you can purchase a try me set for less money.

highly recommended. prisrob 04-15-17",2017-04-15,5,5,A1TPW86OHXTXFC,B00175YVNO

regarding the marine creme, i haven't found it to be of any use. elemis boasts this as their most popular product but i can't understand why as i see no real benefit. in fact, my complexion was more congested after using this. considering the massive price-tag, this earns it a very low rating.

2531,"this stuff is amazing. there's no other word for it. i purchased this because my skin has been completely going off the rails lately and my chin has been breaking out yet has been extremely dry, flaky, and has been peeling and irritated, almost like its chapped. it's been quite painful and i've used every oil, every moisturizer with healing/calming benefits i can get my hands on and nothing has worked to moisturize and calm my skin until this.

this spray smells amazing. it smells just like fresh roses. it is not oily or greasy, yet my skin drinks it in and has become softer, less irritated and the peeling and flakiness have completely subsided. my breakouts are reduced by half and are no longer painful and red. my skin is really starting to normalize and it's only been a day and a half! everything i've used on my skin lately has stung except for this spray. i can't even begin to explain the relief i've experienced since my first spray.

this spray does not make your skin feel taught or dry after it dries like some setting/facial mists i have tried in the past. it leaves your skin plump, moisturized and comfortable.

i can't wait to continue using this spray and see what effects it continues to have on my skin and how it works with makeup. i haven't been able to wear makeup in the last few weeks because of my skin issue, and i'm going to wait a few more days to attempt it, but i'm anticipating a lot of good things.

this spray says once you try it you won't want to be without it...well, that couldn't be more accurate. this spray is one of the best skincare products i have found in recent memory and definitely worth the time and investment. couldn't be happier and neither could me skin.",2016-10-10,5,5,A16VM71BLBCMMK,B00172O9NO

2546,"i can't believe how much i'm loving this product. first off let me say i have acne-prone, sensitive skin with eczema and have been in a near-constant battle with my skin for over 20 years now. it's tough to find a product that is effective without nasty side effects and that i really like and find comfortable on my skin. lately i've been successful in finding some new-to-me products and this is one of them.

feels light and airy but doesn't feel like like a cool water being spritz (like a thermal water spray) instead it has a substance to it (but as i said is still light and airy) and i hesitate to use the word film because that sounds negative but i don't mean it that way-it has a film-like or slightly sticky to the touch texture if sprayed liberally over skin. it sinks in quickly though and that goes away with it. it is not bothersome or time consuming.

causes me no breakouts, redness or pink blotches, no itching or burning, no stinging to the eyes and has been gentle on my skin.

smells pleasant with a flowery and rose-esque fragrance.

is an amazing makeup setter and even better at helping me apply my bb cream or foundation: after applying all my moisturizer, serums, sunscreen etc and let that absorb i spray my face with this stuff several times (maybe 4 which might be too much for some people but i like it) and let it sit on my skin for 10-30 seconds as it absorbs. but, before it's fully absorbed and dried i then apply my bb cream (or foundation/concealer etc) with my fingertips (you can use a brush of course if you want) and it blends sooo smoothly and really gives more of a flawless, hydrated, airbrushed look. it is not oily looking at all but just perfectly blends my makeup and i can't believe how much better my makeup looks since i started using this to apply my bb cream. i've also used it to set makeup after fully finishing applying it and it does stay on and stay put longer. the idea with the bb cream application is similar to a makeup sponge dipped in water--i guess it does the same type of thing.

also very refreshing to just spray now and then over my makeup later in the day or on bare skin.

i can't imagine doing my makeup without this now and am so pleased with the results. i've wanted to try a floral water for a long time, this is my very first one and i'm sticking with it. l o v e it. can't recommend it enough.",2016-06-14,5,5,A1EJ9DSKSM0UN1,B00172O9NO
2547,"this does not work for me to set makeup at all. it does give me a dewy, shiny look but it does not have the same fixing effect as my mac or nyx products. it feels more like a rosewater solution that is nice over a powder foundation on dry skin. for already oily skin it may make it too shiny looking unless a matte product is used as makeup.

i do love the fragrance and the cooling feel of the mist. i think i will end up using it more during the winter than summer, or maybe even after a harsh, hot and drying day in the sun. it's a great product, it's just not very useful for me as a make-up fixing spray.",2016-06-06,4,3,A6VPK7X53QNAQ,B00172O9NO

based on his feed back hot tools are a top choice for professionals for a couple of reasons:

* they hold up to commercial use

* have a reliable thermostat which apparently is essential, who knew?

* solid warrantee

* comfortable grip

as for sizing the one inch is the most popular and any hair stylist worth their salt can make any size curl or wave with the one inch diameter rod. the price on amazon was the best - beating out even the closed to the general public beauty supply houses that cater only to professionals.

over the years i've found this to be true with virtually all tools of trade and recently bought him a pair of $700 kamisori shears for $265 with free shipping to boot. as for the curling iron it arrived in it's sealed retail packaging and again with a prime membership you get free two day shipping to boot.",2013-02-23,5,5,A11FX8HL2ANK6T,B00176B8BG

2613,"this is the curling iron that you wanted as a teenager when you bought your first one from target and spent hours cursing it because it wouldn't hold a curl at all. this iron is the preferred iron of stylists for a reason-it is a workhorse, and it is fabulous.

i have this iron in three sizes. i have the 1", the 1.25" and the 2". this size is by far my most used size. i have mid back length hair and it's medium thickness. it is wavy by nature but i typically curl it after blow drying it straight. this iron has been my go to after years of use, and it still looks as good as the day i bought it-8 years ago. it's in pristine condition and it works like a charm, and it gets used.

there are adjustable settings for the temperature on here-it's a dial-set it once and then leave it alone. not like electronic ones where you have to reset it every time you use it. i do wish this had an auto off feature, that's my one thing i want that newer irons have. the barrel on here is the perfect size for most hair types. it gives the loose barrel curl type, the "victoria's secret curl" a lot of girls are after. the longer you hold the curl, the better longevity you will get. i have experimented with this thing for years and gotten tons of variety with it.

there is a longer barrel version of this floating out there now for women with really long hair, and i feel like while that might be useful, it might be harder to manhandle as well. this works well for me even when my hair has been exceptionally long. i think that had i known to buy this on amazon back in college, i could have saved some money. the clamp is really strong, and while the iron comes with a replacement spring, i have not needed to replace mine in almost a decade of ownership with heavy usage.

if you are looking for a quality iron that will last a long time and won't leave you penniless, this is worth it. only a few bucks more than the generic cheap equivalents, and it will work like a horse and leave you looking gorgeous.",2016-06-20,5,5,A1F1SGYXCMVHF4,B00176GSEI

2700,"this curling iron really works on my hard-to-curl shoulder-length hair. the drugstore model i had bought does not. perhaps it's because this one can get so hot (adjustable temp)and/or the metal it's made with (it's heavier than the one from the drug store) seems to be higher quality. and it does not damage or singe my hair. it works so well, the larger 1 1/2" version may have done the job, don't know...will stay with this one. perhaps the slightly smaller, but still fairly large, barrel makes it so i don't have to hold it as long, maybe requiring less heat? the only thing i wish were different is that it does not have an automatic shut-off, and i keep leaving it on by accident--which would be a problem with young children in the house. am wondering if the spare springs are needed because others do the same? anyway, this curling iron has dramatically improved the look of my fine hair. i use it to add body at the ends, not for curly curls, but am sure it would also work well for curlier styles.

update: it's almost four years since i wrote the review, and the curling iron is still going strong! i carry the extra spring in my suitcase, and haven't needed it as of yet. oh, and my husband got me an auto shutoff device that i plug into an outlet, and the curling iron into this widget, and so now i have auto shutoff!

2702,"first, i meant to order the 1" curling iron so i'm going to give you the approximate circumference of the 3/4" one which is 2 7/8".  when i hold the measuring tape up next to the barrel it measures 3/4".  my hairdresser cut my layers a tad too short last time so my mistake worked in my favor. i'd be burning myself quite often if i was using the 1" size.

i have a 1" hot tool curing iron, just like this one, that i've been using for over 6 years. my husband replaced the plug once because i had to keep wiggling the cord & plug to get everything in the proper place for the curling iron to stay on. recently i began having problems with the cord again, but this time it's where the cord attaches to the handle & that is why i was ordering another curling iron. this new design is supposed to prevent that problem...only time will tell. i will update my review if necessary.

these irons come with two extra springs...i didn't have to use the extra springs with my old one, but i'm very happy the extras are included. (we've had to replace the springs in other curling irons i've owned through the years. it was never easy to find a replacement spring). the temperature settings/numbers eventually wore off of my old one & i'm expecting this one to do the same because they're applied in the same manner. i have a favorite setting.  i marked my old one with a silver permanent marker so i'd know which setting to use. although these curling irons get very, very hot i do not & will not use the higher settings. for goodness sakes, my hair isn't made from asbestos. fyi: my hairdresser recently burned a section of my hair off when her curling iron was set too hot. thankfully, it was in a hidden spot, i don't have long layers, and i was able to cover the burned off hair until it grew back. anyway, let that be a warning to you...it can happen. i've used curling irons for years & years & years & that was a first for me & my hairdresser.  i use the #7 temperature. it's the first setting on the 'extra hot' category. my baby fine hair is extremely hard to curl. if this curling iron lives up to its predecessor, i can expect many more useful years out of it.  and, soon, i will be placing an order for the 1" size.

2751,"my sister recommended mario badescu drying lotion, so i decided to give it a try. one very big positive is the price. in my experience, many skin care products are scams that can cost a fortune. 17.00 is a fair price for this product. the lotion (thought it's not really a lotion) contains salicylic acid and chamomile. most people probably know that salicylic acid is a very common and inexpensive product used to treat acne, which can also reduce redness. chamomile is also used to reduce redness, so the formula of combining the two seems like a good idea.

the directions are simple. apply your usual nighttime moisturizer before applying the drying lotion. make sure you allow your moisturizer to dry thoroughly before applying the drying lotion. then, dip a qutip in the bottle of drying lotion, and apply it to problem areas on your face. make sure to buy extra long qutips because regular qutips barely reach the bottom of the bottle. once you have used about half of the product, you are going to want an extra long qutip.

now, how effective is this product? i think it is just as effective as something like proactiv. the drying lotion is not a miracle by any means. does it work? yes, it works to some extent. it works to the extent that salicylic acid has always worked. will you have dramatically clearer skin overnight? no. will you have clearer skin after a few days? yes. but this product is not a miracle or a new formulation that we have never seen before, and this product does not prevent acne. many of the reviews fail to mention that this product is actually intended for use on whiteheads. i rarely have whiteheads, so i mainly used the drying lotion on your average red pimples. so i can say that the product does work on average pimples to an extent, but it's no better than proactive, retin-a, or anything else you might have tried. i tried the drying lotion on a few whiteheads, and, again, it's not a miracle worker. it works as effectively as most other products i have tried.

i will buy this product again for two reasons: the price is fair, and i do not want to pay a dermatologist to prescribe me benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. the dying lotion is a good product, but it's not a miracle. set your expectations reasonably, and you should be fine.",2016-09-12,4,4,A1HM4GGGNKZ37B,B0017SWIU4

i docked a star for the frustrating package it comes in. if the bottle was a little wider and shorter it would be perfect. when you get to the bottom of the bottle, you can't really reach it with a regular sized felt-tipped swab, for one thing, and for another usually the alcohol will completely dry out before you even get to the stuff so it dries into powder (i have gone through two bottles already). the last of the product is wasted unless you add a little of your own alcohol to the bottle and dig a cotton swab in there, covering your fingers in the residue at the top.",2016-01-06,4,3,A17SNTLDQWMULL,B0017SWIU4

one of the things i love most about mb products is that they have fewer ingredients and do not irritate my skin.  whenever possible i try to use more natural products on my skin and i regularly use a variety of cleansing masks along with my clarsonic in order to keep my skin clear.  this drying lotion can sometimes sting a little when i put it on if i tried squeezing a pimple (yes, i know, against the rules..but it happens!), but if i use this before bed i will wake up and find that my large red pimples have shrunk significantly overnight.  depending on the size of the breakout sometimes it disappears completely within a day!

of all of the mb products that i have tried this my favorite acne treatment solution--i believe anyone who has acne prone sensitive skin would find it extremely beneficial.  the best way to apply it is to use a clean q-tip and dip it through the clear solution and down into the pink powder at the bottom.  it is the combination of these two ingredients that will help to clear breakouts.  this is a highly recommended product and it definitely is a worthwhile investment and lasts a long time for the price you pay--usually a bottle lasts me at least 6 months!",2015-08-04,5,5,A12ZFSESFYJF2G,B0017SWIU4

(usually back, chest and cheeks), wait 15 minutes naked then put on my pajamas and go to bed.  the smell is pretty bad and my room has this smell lingering but who cares!  this really dries out active pimples and "opens up" under the skin cysts. i have noticed even when i use a little bit on a pimple not only will that pimple go down, but the surrounding areas will break out less often.  maybe it's killing the bacteria that spreads and causes more acne?  either way it's definitely not a cure-all or even an overnight cure but it is consistently effective in reducing bumps and pimples and when you're dealing with an all out attack, this helps tremendously.

my only complaint is that it goes by waaay too fast and i have a ton of the pink stuff left at the bottom of the bottle but none of the alcohol liquid that sits on top of it. (so i have squired witch hazel and rubbing alcohol in it to make it last, it still seems to work this way)

i used this item maybe 6 times during a 3 week period. i followed the directions closely, and used it on a few acne spots on my face. out of the few, only one whitehead disappeared within a few days. i don't know if it's because of this item, or the fact that i for once didn't pick at my skin and left it alone, or that i used a clarisonic brush on my face daily. but since the other acne spots didn't disappear either, i contribute it to the fact that i didn't mess with my face and tried very hard to keep my face clean and moisturized.

2859,"i like some juice beauty products and dislike others.  this one is in the "like" column, with one caveat (which i'll get to in a moment).

this is quite gentle.  it foams when you rub it against your face, and it does a good job of removing dirt and oil without drying out your skin.  it rinses off cleanly, as well.  so as a cleanser, it's quite good.

i also think this helped my skin heal after a recent breakout, probably faster than it would have otherwise, and i didn't get any new blemishes during the first week of using it (which is how long i've used it so far).  this is with once-daily use (i keep mine in the shower and use it at night -- it definitely seems to help removing stubborn oil-based makeup).

and now, the one thing i don't care for: the scent.  this smells acidic and almost vegetable-like.  i can't think of a better way to describe it.  it's an effective product, and it's not like you're using it for a long time, so i can put up with the scent.  but i don't enjoy the scent at all.

here is the full ingredients list since i didn't see it on the product page:

organic lemon juice, organic sweet cherry juice, organic white grape juice, organic aloe juice, decyl glucoside, vegetable glycerin, sodium hydroxide, gluconolactone, sclerotium gum, xanthan gum, lysolecithin, pullulan, sodium benzoate, sodium levulinate, organic sage leaf extract, dandelion leaf extract, lemon balm leaf extract, algae extract, tocopherol, retinyl palmitate, lime oil, tetrasodium glutamate diacetate, sodium anisate, citric acid, may chang, organic bitter orange and organic ylang ylang pure essential oils

if you are into organic and natural ingredients, as well as plant-based ingredients, you will like this product a lot, i suspect.  juice beauty products are not tested on animals.",2015-05-10,4,5,A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,B001F0D11Y
2860,"i love the feel of the juice beauty blemish clearing cleanser. it makes my face feel good. it also is doing a very good job of cleaning, which seems to make my skin happy, which makes me happy.  the ingredients and the fact that it's organic are a major plus for me.",2015-01-24,5,5,A3OXRFCJI67IMN,B001F0D11Y
2861,"i've been using this juice cleanser for about one month.  different products work for different people - for me this juice is a bit too drying on my skin for me to use it daily.  but on the other side of the coin i do use it a few times per week and it makes my skin look less oily.  all organic and smells all organic (kind of a seaweedy smell to me).  goes on light and slick on the skin (not lathery) and washes off easily.  it does seem to help reduce blemishes for me.

overall, i'll continue using this juice beauty occasionally for "shine control" in conjunction with another daily cleaner i use that doesn't dry out my skin as much (and also is much cheaper).  at $22 for 6.75 oz this juice cleanser is on the pricier side relative to some other options out there but if it suits you best then you can't put a price on that.  for me, the higher cost is palatable since i'm only using it occasionally - overall i rate this juice cleanser 4 stars in consideration of price/value.",2014-12-19,4,4,A2V2URLB31HG59,B001F0D11Y

the ingredients list is impressive, and the fragrance is mild and natural. i definitely feel good about using this wash.

i can see where this cleanser would be excellent for people with oily or break out  prone skin. i have regular to dry skin, and find daily use to be too harsh. as a result, i only use this wash a couple times a week. the drying results is the only real complaint i have about the product.",2014-12-18,4,5,AZ0PCEZUTF5QO,B001F0D11Y

for me, the smell is not nearly as bad as i thought it would be. so, if this was a deterrent for you, i would suggest trying it. everyone is different.

the product does a nice job of cleansing and has good rinse-ablilty.

when used as directed, the bottle should last a bit long than you might expect (it is a pretty small bottle for the price). moreover, no one ever regrets adding more natural/organic/vegan/cruelty-free products to their regimen.",2014-12-17,4,3,A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M,B001F0D11Y

i started using it all over my face but i found that it dried out my normal to dry areas too much. i have stared just using it on the blemish prone areas which has helped the dryness.  i also then use cetaphil gentle skin cleanser on the rest of my face. the combination of products works ok, but i am still getting the usual break outs in all the usual places.  i understand that some break outs are hormone related so maybe that is why i am not having any luck with this and other people are.  of the natural product washes i have tried, this is the one i liked the best.

i really did want to like it. there wasn't a residue feeling on my face after using it, it was fragrance free and all-natural, but my skin simply requires something more potent to keep the blemishes at bay. it might work well as an 'in-between' wash when you just want a clean feeling without a rigorous scrub. still, the sugar content makes me nervous. in the end, i'm sure it works for some people and not for others. it just didn't work for me.",2014-12-06,3,2,AY6A8KPYCE6B0,B001F0D11Y

2. he uses it everyday.

the pump style of this bottle makes it easy to use without distributing too much at once. i only use one pump each time!  i think this size would last a good two months with regular use. the pump can be locked or unlocked easily which is good when you have overly curious kids or if aiming to travel with this product.

the cleanser lathers lightly and has quite a pleasant smell. i wasn't sure with the lemon, cherry, aloe, sage and other ingredients but they blend well together. the scent doesn't tend to linger for long after use either which is fine by me. a big pro is this skincare product is all-natural. i will continue to use it after such positive results and am eager to see what else if offered in this skincare line.",2014-11-21,5,4,A194K60CWZ371J,B001F0D11Y

on the other hand, my spouse doesn't like this cleanser. she has sensitive skin and the cleanser makes it feel too dry. she ends up having the need to use moisturizer after every wash.

the cleanser is indeed effective but, as i mention above, he can only use it at night because... well... it smells. it's not overwhelming but... we know teenagers, they can't stand embarrassment. the other issue is, of course, price. there are similarly effective cleansers that can be had for significantly less and are even fragrance-free.

i'll keep using this as it's one of the best face washes i've found.

update to 5 stars: i've been using this for a few months once a day and just finished my first bottle. my skin has never looked better and i've had far fewer breakouts than ever before. i can't believe i'm spending this amount of money on a face wash (i'm normally a $6.99 neutrogena girl), but this is so worth it to me.",2014-11-19,5,5,A11IKWE7B29TOJ,B001F0D11Y

2889,"not to be a buzz-kill to the all natural front as i know there are some die-hards out there, but in the case of this wash it is just too overpriced for something that does very little. yes, it seems to be non-drying and non-irritating to sensitive/oily skin, but so are products like basis or cetaphil - both common washes that dermatologists typically recommend because they too are gentle and non-irritating, and c-h-e-a-p-e-r. but to each his/her own. this wash will not expunge all of the makeup and dirt - you will have to use a towelette or pre-wash before you wash with this in order to get everything off your face. or you may have to consider a toner of some kind after in order to eliminate any remaining makeup residue. like another reviewer said, it's like water. there isn't much to it. smells ok, lemon-esk to me. otherwise, it isn't praise-worthy to me.

sept update
after several months of use i've found the acne blemish kit - which includes this wash is completely unsuitable for sensitive skin. if you have ss, run far and fast from this particular line. perhaps jb's other products are good, but this line left a sour taste so to speak. ultimately it ravaged my face and i had to abandon the use. when i addressed this with jb they refused to refund me. instead they line to encourage users to keep using it passed the 45 day refund period by saying it can take up to 2 months to see results. so buyer beware. be prepared to be stuck with it if you hate it. they don't seem to care that it gave me blackheads, which i never had before, and caused the cystic acne to spread and swell. the purge is a marketing plow. there is no such thing. if you find it is irritating after 2 weeks stop using it. it is not the purge, unless you consider inflammation a purge. company failed to back their product to my satisfaction.",2013-08-16,1,3,A12GK5JUYAV0HM,B001F0D11Y

i like the fact that you can roll it down as you use it just like an oversized tube of toothpaste (it is very generously portioned for a hand cream). makes it more convenient to use plus i can squeeze it right to the point of where i need it to come out.....it doesn't overflow, it only dispenses pretty much exactly what you need.

that being said this hand cream is a little higher in price than what i normally pay for a hand cream but i wanted to try this brand. i do like it, don't know whether or not i'll purchase it again at this price point when i can get something that does as good of a job at moisturizing my dry hands for a lot less. definitely a luxury item.",2017-09-22,5,5,A2Z8B2KA8K07DM,B001GAOUZY

shea butter is one ingredient i always look for when buying hand creams. my wife swears by it and so do i. but you need more than just a small smidgen of shea butter in the ingredients list to be effective. this l'occitane hand cream contains 20% shea butter plus almond and honey extracts in addition to coconut oil. what a great combination. enough shea butter to provide superior performance but not so much to leave your hands feeling like you just slathered them in crisco. together these ingredients provide a long lasting, mostly non-greasy protection and moisturization for dry, chapped hands. it has a pleasant fragrance.

a little bit goes a long way unlike the cheap thin and runny hand lotions that you can buy. with those you seem to need to squirt it on your hands much more frequently. it's no wonder because many of them have water as a primary ingredient.

this is an excellent hand cream that although is more expensive than many other hand creams has far superior qualities than most.

2921,"the shea butter l'occitane hand cream is the best hands down, or hands up. it is enriched with 20% shea butter, and the creamy balm penetrates quickly to protect, nourish and moisturize the skin. honey, almond and coconut oil are blended with shea butter to create this effective moisturizer.

i found this hand cream via a friend a few years ago, and i have not been without it since that time. i wash my hands frequently and need to moisturize my hands often. this small tube lasts a long time because you need very little amount each time. that little amount you use will moisturize your hands so well that you can go through few hand washings and the cream stays on. i cannot say enough about the quality of this hand cream. this stays in my purse at all times. this is the best hand cream i have ever tried and i have tried multiple kind from 99 cents to expensive kinds.

2922,"this is one of the most effective hand creams i have found. i'm a professional landscaper, and my hands get thrashed. but nobody knows that, because each night i exfoliate and moisturize heavily so that i can still have nice hands.

this is a wonderful cream because it sinks in, doesn't sting cracked skin, and really provides long-lasting protection and healing. one tube lasts forever, in fact i usually get the gift set of small tubes of l'occitane hand creams just for some variety, and i find that the three small tubes easily last me the year.

the two things i dislike are the scent, which smells a bit like old-lady cold cream - not unpleasant, but a bit more perfumey than i like, and the cap, which is fiddly and hard to get back on once you've moisturized your hands.

other than that, this is a highly effective cream that works great for healing hands that have been in the dirt.",2011-01-21,4,5,A2MBLVMVDLHK1L,B001GAOUZY

2932,"i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave, as well as the green soap and preshave. i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.

the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. to me, it smells like tea tree oil. a somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre-shave. i apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. with a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. i was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. highly recommended.

i find the value of this product is simply incredible.  with a badger brush i get fantastic, perfect lather and this product last many months before i need to order more. i find using one drop of shave secret oil in my mix is preferred but not required to get that perfect shave!

2936,"04/06/2016 update - almost 3 years now, the original jar is still about 40% full. i've since tried proraso green and proraso red, also love them. you can get them really cheap at italian barber website.

12/14/2015 update - just a little observation: i've heard it before and then experienced it myself: this soap only works well in soft water. for a while my water softener was not working (due to a "salt bridge", resolved now) and i couldn't even use proraso - it deflated after applying to face and was no good by second pass. i found that the tabac stick works best for that. but after my soft water returned i tried it again yesterday and it was great. btw, if you have hard water, you can just try using distilled water to lather your soap, that should work, can't get any softer than distilled :) also need to make sure there's not too much water in the lather.

i switched from the cheap "can spray" foam, so i haven't tried many other high end shaving soaps and other products, but i am very pleased with proraso (also had a bottle of aftershave lotion, but it was glass and i dropped it and it broke). the smell is exquisite, makes you feel like you're in a different income bracket ;) it tends to stay with you during the day, if you don't mask it with other fragrances, which is great!

so far i had a few friends try it and they were hooked.

please don't cheat yourself and get a nice brush.

i used it with straight edge and more recently with double edge safety razor, but it's great even with cartridge razors (but please do yourself, your face and your budget a favor and switch to de or straight edge).",2015-04-01,5,5,A1AD4XP47VS56Y,B001JHEY14

shaving- let me save you years of trial and error: take a warm shower & wash your face with billy jealousy exfoliating facial cleanser, shave afterwards with a $50 merkur safety razor handle with good blades (save $100's on mach 3 refills!), use a $20 tweezerman badger hair shaving brush to apply taylor of old street bond (or proraso) shaving cream (you can let it set in a minute), shave with the grain down, slowly, softly (don't press hard- let the weight of the handle and sharp blade do the cutting), lastly rub on a fingertip of proraso pre/post shave cream while your face is still wet and let it dry! say goodbye to razor bumps and ingrown hairs forever! trust me- i've tried dozens of pricey face washes, shaving creams, and after shaves over the last 4 years. if you don't want to commit so much money yet- order the pre/post shave proraso cream online, buy proraso shave cream online or at bath and body works (under their c.o. bigelow label) then get the cheap single blade disposables (mach 3's are too aggressive) at a grocery store and you'll notice a difference overnight.",2012-12-03,2,5,A1DMRK2YINRC16,B001JHEY14

the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. to me, it smells like tea tree oil. a somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre-shave. i apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. with a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. i was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. highly recommended.

2964,"good stuff!
when i first got into de shaving i tried all kinds of esoteric shave creams, soap etc. after the dust settled and my wallet was empty i found the proraso shave soaps. i find with a good badger brush and possibly a drop of shave oil this soap is all one needs for the perfect close shave! i like the green proraso sometimes a bit better than this white and sometimes i prefer this white so i keep both on hand and alternate.
i find the value of this product is simply incredible.  with a badger brush i get fantastic, perfect lather and this product last many months before i need to order more. i find using one drop of shave secret oil in my mix is preferred but not required to get that perfect shave!

i recently fell and bruised my arm, very dark bruise, in fact.  i figured i would try it on that bruise since it was too dark for my face.  covered the bruise just fine, still darker than my skin but better than purple.  the concealer itself seemed a little pricey but i went ahead and ordered the "light beige" and hope it comes soon.  the pen is small but easy to work.  how much is actually inside the pen is anybody's guess.  after i try the lighter color, i shall come back and revise this review.  i feel sure, though, that the other will work fine.",2017-02-21,4,4,A368H9GFY1JCYC,B001NZ1OWO

i like the "pen" delivery system, as you can get just a little of the concealer out at one time, without a lot of waste. the deep beige color is a little dark for my winter skin tone, but i am sure i will use it a lot in the summer time. i love that the product is both fragrance and allergen-free, as well.",2017-02-18,5,5,A29VG90T649CSU,B001NZ1OWO

2983,"i have tried several la roche-posay products.  they are a good brand. this concealer is no exception.

color:
i tried both the light beige and yellow beige. i tried 2 tones because i was afraid the light beige might have a rose undertone, which looks bad on me.  lucky, the light beige is a neutral beige, and just the right shade for my fair skin.  i think the yellow beige would look better on light olive or asian skin tones. the yellow beige still goes on okay for me, if i put it on under foundation, but it takes longer to blend in and not as seamless a color for me.

coverage:
i gave this product 4 stars because how well it conceals depends on what you are trying to cover.  i have a few acne spots that are slowly fading from breakouts.  using this product, i can conceal light spots with 1 coat.  i can conceal medium dark spots with 2 coats and a layer of foundation.  the concealer doesn't work as well on dark spots. some dark spots don't stay concealed for very long, even with a few layers of concealer and foundation, so i have to re-apply later in the day.

conclusion:
so although i find this product useful, i'm not sure i will automatically buy another one in the future. the la roche-posay foundation that i use, which i give 5 stars, does a good job on its own, except when i have dark spots. this product has a limited effect on dark spots, so i might try other concealers before buying this one in the future.  that being said many concealers have the same issues as this one with dark spots, so that's why i still might consider this in the future, and gave it a high rating..",2017-06-07,4,5,A3HCZTTUH3CW9Z,B001NZ1OWO

i do have sensitive skin and this product did not cause any irritation for me.

i will mention a couple things about packaging that i did not like.  first of all this comes wrapped in plastic that has a perforation down the side so that you can get the plastic off...i could not get the plastic off of concealer stick.  it would not tear, i ended up having to take a knife and cut down the side through the plastic...it was such a pain.

second this concealer has a brush applicator on the end.  the brush bristles are pretty stiff and they hurt when i used them under my eye.  i ended up brushing product onto my finger and then applying under my eyes with my fingers.  additionally the brush gets kind of goopy with dried product over time which i don't like.

overall this product worked well but wasn't my favorite.  it covers well and has decent staying power as long as you set it with powder.  however it felt a bit thick to me.  additionally i really didn't like the brush applicator; it was too stiff to use in sensitive facial areas (under my eyes).  i will use this batch of it but probably won't be buying again. i would recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/bareminerals-stroke-of-light-eye-brightener/dp/b008xcnj0k/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8">bareminerals stroke of light eye brightener</a>&nbsp;as a better alternative if you are trying to cover undereye circles.",2017-04-30,4,3,A22B13EJTZKCTM,B001NZ1OWO

2999,"this is a great concealer. the brush is perfect for dabbing onto spots as needed, as well as outlining your brows if you're into the whole brow craze right now. it blends so very nicely. i use my finger to blend after applying it to my face with the brush.

normally i only use foundation, and that isn't even very often anymore. i have melasma on my forehead, cheek bones, upper lip, and my chin. foundation isn't gonna do anything for all that, so i had stopped even bothering at least 5 years ago or longer. i use it once in a while, but not daily or weekly like i used to. i never really used concealer, either. i had tried a few over the years, but never liked how they were cakey, laid in pores and fine lines, and how they seemed to smear up and just makes applying foundation a mess ... too much stuff on the skin. so, out of curiosity and trusting the brand (i love their products and use many of them) i decided to try this one. the first time i used it, i was astonished and hooked.

you only need the tiniest bit, so the pen is going to last a while. almost my entire forehead is covered in melasma. i decided to dab some of this concealer on and see what happened. i twisted up a "click's worth" and after doing my forehead, i still had plenty left on the brush. i dabbed some on a few random old pimple spots and then moved onto the melasma on my cheekbones. it is really high up on my cheekbones - right underneath the bone that you can feel under your eye, so it sort of gives the look of huge dark circles under my eyes and just creates a look like dark shadows on my face. it interferes with blushes, bronzer, highlighter etc, because all of these products just make the patch more noticeable. oh man, when i put it on there, i could not believe my eyes. seriously. it covered it and i cannot tell you how long it has been that my face looked like it was all one shade without the nasty brown marks. they're big and go from about the corner of my eye, across the very top of the cheekbone and out towards my temple, stopping past the outside corner of my eye. it is a crescent shaped patch (thinner at the ends and fatter in the middle) on both sides of my face. i almost wanted to cry after seeing it look so good. i looked good. i miss my face being all one shade and looking nice. this concealer gave me that back, even if it is temporary.

it blends into my skin so very well and doesn't feel like it is laying on top of the skin. you do not need to build it up on the skin to get coverage. it feels like a sheer coverage product, but acts like a full coverage. it is so perfect. i can use it just by itself, with no other make up, and it looks fine. it doesn't look like patches of make up on my skin.

to do my forehead, both cheekbone areas, my chin, and a few tiny random old pimple scars, i used less than 2 clicks worth of product. there was still some left on there, so i decided to just outline my brows and then there was still enough product left on the brush that i could do above my eye lids, under the brow, to hide those pesky little dark veins, etc., and even out that skin tone. (am i the only one that feels like my eye lids/eye area always needs foundation or primer.. or something.. to even out the tone?) anyway, if i wanted to, i could still brush it on my skin and get some coverage with what was left on there. so, you definitely get a lot of use out of a tiny bit of it.

it does well right under my eyes, also, without getting the crepe look, but i do use a good moisturizer first. as with most foundations and concealers, you will want to make sure you are very well exfoliated so that neither product will stick to dry spots and accentuate them. if skin tends to be dry, use a little moisturizer. it will make a big difference in regards to seeing the makeup settle into the pores and becoming visible.

the first time i used this, my daughter asked me where i was going. she thought i was getting dressed up and doing my makeup to go away. she asked what i used on my face and i showed her the pen and said, "this." she did not believe that, that was all i had put on and said my face looked so good and that you couldn't even tell "the brown marks" were there anymore. i use make up for ever face and body foundation which i always felt did a great job to cover things up - it is used to cover tattoos, etc - but this concealer is even better. i love it and i will absolutely be buying more when this runs out. my skin has not looked this good in yeeearrrrssssss. i feel like a weirdo in an infomercial, but i do not even care. this is a blessing of a product to me and i do love it.

also, psa : use sunscreen. always! always! always! my melasma is from the sun. i never had a bad sunburn or anything like that. my face has never peeled due to a sunburn. i never had any indication that i had any type of sun damage, then one day out of the blue i noticed these spots crept up on me. first thick patches along the tops of my eye brows. then i noticed how it ran up the center of my forehead and then branched across. it wasn't even sunny! they didn't pop up in the middle of summer, or after spending a lot of time outdoors, etc. it wasn't summer at all when they showed up, it was was actually the very end of winter turning to spring. it was just when they chose to show up. after all the years spent in the sun without enough sunscreen, and who knows how many years my mom left me play outside without any, the damage finally decided to say hello. and that is the thing with sun damage - it shows up years and years later, randomly. don't ever for a second think that you're ok because you don't see any damage, or you didn't have a bad sunburn, etc. the damage will show up later in life. use the sunscreen! i have to use it now even just going on a 10 minute trip in the car to pick my daughter up at work. if i don't, well i can plan on my dark spots getting even darker. imagine how fun that is! especially above my upper lip. looks like i have a great mustache sometimes. sunscreen, people, sunscreen. please and thank you!",2017-04-26,5,5,A1QBOC76MIOJYP,B001NZ1OWO

3003,"the most important part of my make up routine is my undereye concealer as i've been plagued by dark circles since i was a teen due to thin skin under my eyes and chronic allergies. i've tried at least a dozen mainstream brands and have one brand i've stuck with a long time as it's a great texture and does the best job minimizing my dark circles of all the brands i tried over the years. but i'm happy to try the toleriane teint light beige concealer pen as it's turned out to be an excellent concealer that i'll continue to use as well. while i get slightly better coverage with my regular concealer, toleriane teint is a really good product, the light beige color is a better match for me and the applicator pen is superior to the little squeeze tube that holds my regular concealer. the pen is less messy and allows me more control over how much i use, and the bristles are an effective way to distribute the concealer exactly where i want it (though the bristles are not designed for blending).

the light beige shade is the best match to my skin tone i've ever come across. my skin has olive and pink tones, but i'm fair skinned as i don't tan myself. this is a cream concealer with a perfect consistency as it's not runny like some i've tried and is thick enough to cling to my skin and give me good, even coverage. i apply it after my eye cream, and it never looks cakey, shiny or greasy. i just dab a light series of dots with the brush under my eyes, in the corners and on my lids (and i dab it on other imperfections too) and blend with my finger or a concealer brush. the results are quite natural looking and there's no obvious concealer look, especially when i apply and blend lancme dual finish (or other) foundation to even out my skin tone on my face and under my eyes after i've applied the concealer. toleriane teint concealer is very good and provides me coverage that lasts all day, plus it's free of fragrance and preservatives. i don't think i'll ever find a product that covers my dark circles perfectly, but this concealer is one of the best concealers i've tried over the years after trying many brands, and i'll definitely continue to use it.",2017-04-23,5,5,A2L6BT1PVV9YN0,B001NZ1OWO
3004,"this is now my go to product. i especially like the little brush which allows to dab the product under my eye in little spots and then blend it with my fingertip. it blends well with my fair skin tone. i also deal with rosacea which tends to break out with certain cosmetics. needless to say i was pleased that this corrective concealer pen did not cause any outbreaks. i can truly say that this product works for me. i have just overcome a bout of pneumonia and if you can recall the dark circles that come from battling an illness, then you know how rough the appearance of your eyes look after such a bout. this corrective concealer pen completely eliminated the appearance of those dark circles. i am very pleased with this product. the only drawback i could find is that the concealer pen is opaque and therefore you don't know whether or not you are almost out of concealer. as a result, i will probably have to purchase a backup pen just in case.",2017-04-22,5,5,A299RHMH1M9PIW,B001NZ1OWO

i have really dry skin and it's hard to find concealers or foundations that don't look cakey.  i decided to give this a try to help conceal my dark circles and it works really well.  i tried both colors to see which one would work best and i like them both!  i found that the "light beige" is a perfect color for my skin tone, so i use it to conceal imperfections on my face (a little goes a long way) and it covers amazing!  i'm also using the "yellow beige" specifically for dark circle coverage.  it covers great and doesn't crease.  really lightens up the dark circles & brightens the face! i blend it out with my beauty blender and la roche foundation.  really love it.

you don't need to use that much (like i said a little goes a long way) but i am curious to see how long the pen will last.

i'm loving this product and so is my skin!

3011,"very very nice concealer. i use a little bit under eyes in the morning, and it smooths out my complexion nicely, blending into my natural skin tone. if i have any complaint it's that it comes out a little too much at first, so if you don't have a large area to cover, it might be a little difficult to use. other than that, it's a really great product. no irritation or ill effects.",2017-04-20,4,5,A26FEJTPYJ934F,B001NZ1OWO
3012,"the yellow-beige concealer is outstanding at hiding slightly blue discolorations, like veins that are too close to the surface of the skin.  i have a vein near my temple that while not incredibly obvious, i notice. this product allowed for application of a light coat that effectively hid the blue.

this shade is not too yellow like some concealers made for this purpose. it is definitely a muted hue that has just enough yellow but also sufficient beige so it was not necessary for me to apply another coat of a different concealer to hide the yellow on my light/medium beige skin, although depending upon specific use and skin tone, that may be necessary.

the soft brush applicator is very flexible and responsive. after basic application i used a cotton swab as a final step to feather the edges and blend the product. a simple turn of the base dispenses the creamy product and a little goes a long way. the texture is perfect  thick enough to cover but not so thick it drags and/or dries cakey on the skin. also, i have experienced no adverse skin reactions.

the lid tightly snaps on to prevent evaporation. the product is completely encased in clear wrap so it is clear it has not been tampered with, but the trade-off is it is a bit difficult to remove. i used the point of a small knife to cut the wrap and peel it off  some effort was necessary. still it is nice to receive a fresh product clearly pristine. overall excellent tool and easy to obtain good result.",2017-04-19,5,5,A35Q0RBM3YNQNF,B001NZ1OWO
3013,"la-roche-posay color correcting pen is a liquid concealer in a small pencil like tube.  you twist the knob at the base of the tube and concealer comes out onto an applicator brush.

i used about 3 twist of product to correct imperfect colors on my face from age spots to redness.  i also applied this product under my eyes, as it is marketed to cover dark circles.  while i don't have a pronounced problem with under-eye dark circles, i do have imperfect skin from age (53).

the product came tightly wrapped in plastic, which was hard to remove.  i had to use scissors.  while it's good to have a seal on makeup products, this was a little overboard.  it took me several minutes to get a grip on the plastic and cut away the seal.

i have fair skin and would have chosen a lighter shade than the shade i received, but the dark beige actually did cover age spots and red areas on my face.  i applied the product with the applicator brush then blended it in with my fingertips.

the coverage capabilities with this product are good.  my face looks great after application and i haven't even applied foundation yet.

the concealer works great, but the tube is very small.  with the amount of product i used, i can't see this tube lasting more than a few weeks.  i prefer concealer to come in a creme form, preferably in a jar so i can monitor the amount and not run out. this applicator tube is solid white and you won't know you're out until you are out.  therefore  i am not a fan of the delivery system.",2017-04-18,4,3,A2YB7DLC3FOR7W,B001NZ1OWO

update after using it for awhile i'm not very happy with the brush applicator. the brush gets hard and crusty and it hurts to push it against the sensitive skin under my eye. the cream comes up through the middle of the paint brush applicator and i never know till it is too late how much i am pushing out! this is a waist as i use very little and then it gets crusty after a couple days. very happy still with everything.",2017-04-18,4,5,A39BGN8JA7CIFX,B001NZ1OWO

to get to the product, you turn the base and it squeezes out from the inside of the little brush. it uses very little because it seems like it has a lot of pigment. the brush feels too stiff to apply to my face directly, so i have to first get it on my finger and then spread it out, which is less convenient, so this brush system does not make much sense to me. when i apply it with my fingers, it works well, and does not cause irritation.",2017-03-14,3,3,A397CWU6DM3O5G,B001NZ1OWO
3019,"i have an odd tone of skin due to my mix of spanish (olive) and irish/english mix. i am dirty blond/fair, but with a ton of pink/olive/yellow mixed in. therefore, it's super hard to find makeup that works for me, and i have given up on cheap brands and just stuck with lancome over the years for my foundations (which is also not a perfect match, i have to use a blend of two!)  as a corrector stick, this works pretty darn well. the color is obviously not as good as an actually color matched concealer, but that's one thing nice about concealer... it doesn't have to be exact because you put it under your final coat of makeup and blend it in.  this dark beige worked just fine on me. i think the lighter one would still be a tad better, but i just ordered it so we will see.

quality and use is perfect.  the stick worked just fine for me, you just take the lid off and twist the base to make it come out. the thickness was perfect, and others complaining about the brush are just goofy... it's ideal for laying in the concealer in the corner of my eye and under; and i use my fingertips to brush it out and blend it in. it's really perfect. usually just one dose of it is about right for highlighting the area around my eye and getting rid of dark circles. and i have a ton of dark circles right now due to a new baby with health issues, so i know it works!!

the makeup is awesome, nice, thick and creamy and applies wonderfully. it is "wet" but does not shine at all, very matte without looking cakey. especially after being set with a touch up of my powder foundation with a kabuki brush, it's just gorgeous.  i usually follow this routine: lancome's la base primer (it's amazing!), lancome's liquid teint foundation, then i use a highlighter for cheeks, this concealer around the eye corner, and touch up with lancome's dual finish powder foundation and blush.  i know it's expensive, so i don't always take the time to do the concealer and highlighter as well, but it does make a noticeable difference for when you aren't just going shopping or something.  i generally stick to a "no makeup" makeup and this works pretty darn well for that.",2017-03-10,5,4,AUV3OR951650C,B001NZ1OWO
3020,"this product covers imperfections well, and it applies easily.  it is a thicker liquid, so it stays in place well.  i use it to cover my red cheeks.  i apply it, allow it to dry for a couple minutes, apply powder, and then apply foundation.  powder allows the liquid to set, so that my foundation doesn't smear it.

you turn the base until the product appears, and then you apply it.  the application tip is a brush, but i still find it easier to use a makeup brush to spread the makeup.

the plastic wrap on the package took me 5 minutes to get off.  a better wrapping solution would be good.  it was very hard to get off.

what i don't like is the brush. it works fine, and is actually convenient, but seems so unsanitary to me. every time you use it, you'll be picking up bacteria from your skin. even if you wash it, you can't do a thorough job without getting water up in the pen itself.  if i was going to continue using it (and i would, if it was the right color), i would dispense some onto my finger and use it from there. i wouldn't touch the brush to my face.",2017-02-24,4,3,A2OW1FKQFPIA5D,B001NZ1OWO

it washes off very easily, and that might be a positive for some or a negative, depending on how you feel about that.  i find it is a bit too easy to get off, as i often like to spray my face with volcanic thermal water, and that's landed me with the problem of one eye lined and one not after spraying my face and then rubbing an eye.  i really had not realized how bad i am to rub my eyes until i tried this liner. if hands or eyes are moist at all, it will rub off!  but - it won't sting or hurt while doing it.  i'm taking a star off for how easily it comes off.  this is not a product you want to wear to a funeral.  i wouldn't wear it to work out either - sweating combined with an unintentional eye rub and it is gone.

3040,"this is a nice eyeliner, it has a waxy formula that goes on smoothly and blends easily.  it is pretty similar to my go-to eyeliner which is the nyx 'slide on, glide on, stay on' liner.  however, this eyeliner doesn't quite have the staying power of the nyx liner and it also costs more than twice as much.

3046,"the best thing about this eye-liner for me is that it lasts.  my other eye-liner goes on more easily, thicker and more smoothly, but it doesn't last as long.  i think it's oilier or waxier which makes it go on very easily, but then come off easily.

this has a thinner line, but you can go over it again to make it appear thicker and darker.

it didn't irritate my eyes as some eyeliners do.  and it doesn't collect in the corner of my eyes as other eyeliners do.

my only wish is that it sent on more smoothly, but then it might come off more easily.  so, that's a trade-off.  i haven't found an eyeliner which lasts as long as this one does, so if that's what you're looking for, this may be a 5-star product.",2017-12-10,4,4,A1GQAKL9CGQLP1,B001O1K3I8

pros: it's a thick polish that is very easy to manipulate. it's incredibly shiny- i have been doing my own gel nails at home with a gel light for years and this polish looks the exact same as when i do my nails in gel. it dries fast; i painted my nails with the 3 steps and 30 min later it's totally dry. i also love the color. it looks a lot like you dont know jacques.

cons: none yet! i will check back in to see if it truly lasts the 7-10 days as advertised.

3097,"i got the little teasers set and have now used three of the four colors that came in it. "rising star" is a thin-applying, coppery orange with glitter so small it appears as shine. the color, like most opi, goes on easy, but i did decide to use three coats instead of two to get the desired intensity. it is not a pigment intense color. it is, however, quite striking and even though i got a lot of "that's orange, kat" i also got a lot of "it looks really good" along with it, often from the same people. men seem to like this color; women are also intrigued. seeing as how it is autumn right now, this is a good color to wear. it is not too bright or shocking, so it is good to wear with any color; as your fingers turn the shine really kicks in.

i would recommend this for any time of year. i will probably not buy a regular-sized bottle of this, but i will definitely use up the tiny bottle that i have now and wear it with delight.

3098,"the best way to keep it from chipping, or peeling off, is first use mild polish remover on nails to get any oil or dirt off (i have also been told to rough up the nails abit every other week (use a buff bar and use the even out side but do not push hard or do for to long.). after i use the remover and let the nails dry, i use a good base coat, one that helps hold the polish.  i let the base dry for 10 min's or so, then put on 1 thin coat and let it dry 20min's or more then put on jja second thin coat of the polish. after 20+ min's i put on a good top coat, which protects the polish, gives a nice shine and takes away that sand paper feel. you need to put on thiner coats and let it dry longer between coats when using glitter polish.  also it helps to use 100% acetone remover, got mine at walmart, to make it easer then reg or even normal acetone polish remover.
also, you can use a thin coat of colored polish after the base coat and under the glitter to give a little more depth.  with this glitter you can use almost any shade.  such as bronze, red, blue , purple, etc.  use light, dark or anything in-between.

3103,"the pursuit of youth can be very expensive. however, as many people know, skin creams can be a giant ripoff. but, if you find something that truly works, then its worth every penny.

i was excited to try out the tns serum which uses growth factors to make skin look better. growth factors have been in the skincare news for awhile based on their potential. they can, supposedly, rejuvenate collagen and elastin (two important things for the skin) at the cellular level.

however, the research isn't conclusive, with some arguing that the growth factors cant even get into the skin to be effective. theres also been some concern about them creating favorable conditions for skin cancer.

however, most ingredients in skincare have a hard time getting deep into the skin. a good solution to overcome this is micro-needling. if you don't do this already, youll see a huge benefit if you add the practice. its easy and cheap. just google it (or derma rolling).

as for the cancer claims, theres never been any hard evidence or conclusive proof. and, given the overall risk factors many people have for the disease, it would be hard to isolate one factor like this.

after using this cream for several weeks with micro-needling, i definitely notice that my skin looks better. however, i use other items (internally and externally), so its difficult to say this made a huge difference. but, it definitely helped.

given the high price, id research it to make sure its right for you. a lot of people swear by it and, if you have the money, its a good bet to make your skin look more youthful. i will also add that while its only an ounce, a little bit really, really goes a long way.",2018-05-22,4,5,A167ABU99FT4OC,B001QTLNK0
3104,"i've read that skinmedica facial products are some of the best in the business. since i'm at the age where i should be using these kind of products, i was happy to get the chance to try skinmedica tns essential serum.

at almost $300 a bottle, i was expecting it to really work and i was not disappointed. the description says that it supports skin's natural rejuvenation process to improve the overall appearance of skin, including fine lines, wrinkles, tone and texture . i am happy to report that this product does do all these things!! i have only been using this product for about 2 weeks and already see a difference. my skin looks smoother and feels better. the super fine lines are gone (plumped up!) and my skin looks brighter.

this is a sizable container and has a dual pump dispenser. the liquids are white color and dark salmon, not sure which is the ths recovery complex or which is aps corrective complex. you squirt this on the back of your hand, mix with a finger then smooth all over your face and neck. i hope this will last for a while because of the cost but it is so effective i will buy another!",2018-05-21,5,5,A1YX6S4I5GG5VK,B001QTLNK0
3105,"after using this for a few weeks i've already noticed a positive difference with smoother skin.

one of the (many) ingredients at the top of the list is alpha-arbutin.  this ingredient is proven to help lighten age spots because it "works by slowly releasing hydroquinone through hydrolysis, which in turn blocks tyrosinase activity and reduces the skins melanin (pigmentation) production."  the other major ingredients include skin conditioners/moisturizers and antioxidants.

amazon is an authorized reseller for skinmedica products and this is a convenient place to buy this product for less than what they charge at my dermatologist office.",2018-05-20,5,3,A1VGXHHR08G044,B001QTLNK0
3106,"i was going to use the entire bottle before i posted my review but i'm already having problems so here it is. first thing i noticed was how cheap the packaging is. normally that doesn't bother me too much since i'd rather be paying for what's in the bottle than what's outside of it but this packaging is a problem. it's supposed to dispense a red liquid and a white liquid in equal amounts when you press down on the pump however after only a couple weeks it only dispenses the red liquid now. i have to try to cover the red hole and push it down again to get any of the white liquid to come out which makes a big mess and usually just gives me twice as much red as white. it's really annoying. i've cleaned out the tube and everything thinking that maybe it was blocked but it's not. i don't know if the pump dispenser inside the white side came loose but it's not like i've been rough on this bottle or anything. it goes in my drawer and out of my drawer and that's it. as for what it's done for my skin, i'm not really sure i see a huge difference. it's nice and i do like the way it feels on my skin but i can't really see any huge benefits, certainly not any that justify the cost and the crummy packaging. maybe my skin feels a little plumper but i can't really be sure if that's when this product or just my general skin care routine. i might consider trying this again if they changed the packaging but i can't recommend it as is.",2018-05-19,2,3,AFEYHFH2GH0QZ,B001QTLNK0
3107,"after a couple weeks of using this, i can say that i really like the way it makes my skin feel and look. it feels sliky going on and i really do look smoother in the morning, though i can't honestly say whether that's because the product moisturizes really well or actually has potent anti-aging properties. i'm already using retinols, so it's hard to tease out the effects of one product over another. i can definitely say that it agrees with my skin, unlike some people who have reported various negative reactions. why only 4 stars? at this price point, i kind of expected some kind of explosive bang for the buck. this is great stuff, i agree, but is it pushing 300 bucks great? well, i guess that's for you to decide.",2018-05-19,4,4,A1G60ANYI0HMEU,B001QTLNK0
3108,"been using this about a week+ now.  i like it.  it is very moisturizing and you can feel it sink in.  i think my skin looks better,
"fresher".

i've been using clarins double serum for last couple years; sisley, guerlain and channel serums prior (i use after cleansing, after moisturizing day cream).  this seems a little pricey - but probably because i'd never heard of this brand before.  cost wise, it's about in the middle.

so far the only negative (thus 4 stars) is that the pump does not distribute both contents equally at each "pump".  there is a light yellowish cream and a redish color more opaque that come out separately.  pump in your hand, then i rub together and then smooth over face.  i like this, but i expect "perfection" for high end products.

if looking for very nice serum, under moisturizer, try this one.

btw, was happy to review this item since i use anti-aging serums (and i think they work!)",2018-05-16,4,4,AYQ14XGJODM9J,B001QTLNK0
3109,"normally when i am given a facial moisturizer or anti-aging cream for review, i have to try it out for quite a while to see if it lives up to its hype.

in this case, i didn't have to. why? because i used to use this a few years ago and its great. i used to visit a top doctor in beverly hills and i had gotten facials and fillers and some beauty products to try. well, i didn't care much for the fillers, but i did love the products, the main one being this - the skinmedica tns essential serum.

this doctor told me that all the top doctors and aestheticians recommend this product and its the one that he and his staff all use. i don't want to use his name here but youve probably heard of him and he does have an excellent reputation; he never gave me bad advice.

so why did i stop? only because it became too expensive. no stars off for that, because i think a product should be reviewed on how well it works. and it does work.

i do have a recommendation about this -  before you first use the product, tap it solidly on its base on the counter a few times - you want the two serums  to come out evenly and at the same time when you use the pump.

so i do recommend this. it is expensive and you are somewhat restricted in how much you use, since it dispenses the same amount with every pump; so you cant stretch this out to make it last longer. still, it really is great.",2018-05-13,5,5,A2GPJR489OIH42,B001QTLNK0
3110,"i have only been using this product for about a week, but my skin looks more hydrated already.  i've been using it with the skinmedica hydrator and the two products together have made a difference.  knowing the serum was coming, i watched a you tube reviewer review the serum and she said it smelled horrible... i don't think it smells horrible, but it doesn't smell "good" either.  for this price, every aspect of the product should be top-notch, in my opinion.  i still had to give it 5 stars because it's that good. the product has a pump, and when you pump the product out, two separate liquids are dispensed: a red, clear-ish, gel-type liquid and a milky, lotion-type substance.  you're supposed to pump on the back of your hand and then mix together with your fingers and apply.  it soaks in right away and does not leave an oily feel like many other serums.  so far, i really like this serum.",2018-05-13,5,5,A3T7V207KRDE2O,B001QTLNK0

i have put the product on the back of my same hand for over a week and there is no difference in the skin of my hands.  they are equally parchment like, in all the funny little wrinkles.",2018-05-05,2,3,A2503LT8PZIHAD,B001QTLNK0

3115,"yes, it smells slightly bad...but not for long before the scent is gone. it's a medicinal scent; and to be honest, i've smelled worse scents in skincare, l'oreal products come to mind as they are so obnoxiously perfume-y. this absorbs quickly and isn't sticky. i haven't used this serum long enough to see any results, but my face feels very smooth, and make-up goes on easily over this. i'll give updates on any improvements. i'm using only this serum, a plain face moisturizer with no fancy ingredients such as peptides (neutrogena hydro boost) and sunscreen. i read online that if you use peptides, retin a, etc....the strong stuff, that those shouldn't be used the same time as you apply the tns serum...which only makes sense if you think about it, because the ingredients may compete against one another.

skinmedica is a subsidiary of allergan, which makes botox and juvederm, so more than likely a ton of research has gone into making this serum.

3144,"i have to say i'm unimpressed.  from all the positive reviews, i'd expected this babyliss dryer to be so much better than the various less-expensive dryers that i've bought over the years.

it's just "okay" at best -- nothing special at all in my opinion.  i like it no better than and, in some instances, like it less than some dryers that i've paid $35-40 for in the past.

the main things that bug me about it are the temperature and power settings.  other than that, it's fine because the noise level is acceptable and it's reasonably comfortable to hold and maneuver.  but temperature and power setting problems are a pretty big issue in a blow dryer.

there are three temperature settings.  the high heat setting is way too hot to use and burns my scalp the couple of times i tried (maybe i got a bad dryer?).  the medium heat setting is barely warm, so is pretty ineffective at drying hair.  the low setting (cool) is okay.

the two power settings are also off.  one is full-blast-blow-your-hair-all-over-the-place and the other is this meager poof of air that dries too slowly.  neither are very effective imo.

i'd thought that this was maybe just a learning curve until i got used to a new dryer.  but i've been using it for several months and still dislike it.  i'm going back to my $40 dryer.",2017-10-20,2,3,A2IDRAYYZ5GKBZ,B001T0HHDS

i have to say i am now convinced! this dryer, while almost the same wattage as my previous one, dried my hair quickly (my hair is fine, but i have plenty of it), and it was easier to get my cowlicks blown out, which in addition to adding volume, is the other main reason i blow dry my hair at all.

3174,"i was pleasantly surprised by this mascara.  i purchased it based on the recommendation of a friend and i'm glad i spent extra for blinc.  i have had no issues with the liquid splattering out like some users mentioned.  when i asked my friend if she'd ever experienced this she said she had not either.

the way everybody describes "tubes" on your lashes did not match what i envisioned.  i thought this hard little tubes would literally slide off your lashes that you could hold and examine.  this is not at all the case.  to remove the mascara, you only use warm water and gently rub your lashes.  this causes the mascara tubes to get wet and soft turning it a bit like slimy feathers that just clump together and come right off in one good rub of the eyelashes.  you just dump them down the drain (i hope it's ok for my drain!), but maybe they should be dumped into the trash bin?  i don't know.

there is zero residue after removing the mascara.  zero chance of having raccoon eyes later.  it truly is amazing.  i do have to say, however, that some tiny "shreds" can still end up on your upper cheeks after a long day, especially if you're an eye rubber, like me.  it doesn't make raccoon eyes, but some flakes can still end up on your face, which took me by surprise as i didn't see any other reviewers mention that.

pro tip: apply one coat of mascara to entire set of lashes (you can even do lower lashes with this mascara!).  wait 30 seconds and take a dry cotton swab (q-tip) and rub off any mascara that you accidentally got onto your skin (i usually manage to get mascara onto my lids whenever i apply it).  no need to wet it or reapply eyeshadow after wiping off excess mascara with a q-tip.  it wipes right off without any smudging.

second pro tip: don't use eye makeup remover.  it's completely unnecessary and you'll still have to use the warm water technique afterwards anyway.  it's so easy to remove, but amazingly stays on when you don't want it to come off!

while you only get one type of lashes - your own, but slightly thicker and longer - this is good enough for me.  if you're expecting feathered lashes or whatever crazy style of eyelashes other mascara brands promise, you won't get that with blinc.  blinc simply takes your own lashes and makes them appear longer, thicker, darker.  no other crazy promises.

all mascara should be made this way.  i cannot recommend this mascara highly enough.",2017-08-15,5,5,ASJ0MKRFZC47B,B002A9JONI
3175,"best mascara i've ever found, and will never use another again. bear in mind that this mascara does not build or extend lashes like many others will. it is a downside i am willing to sacrifice, as i have small eyes and small lids that lend to guaranteed eyeliner and mascara smudging. i used to rarely wear liner for this reason, and on the infrequent occasions i did, i would spend much of my time fixing the smudges on my lower lids. this liner is not fussy, is easy to apply and remove if one reads and follows the instructions.",2017-08-11,5,3,A31EP5ND68247Q,B002A9JONI

3189,"this product is beautiful and stays on without smudging.  now, i also use the blinc lash primer first, so i don't know what the performance would be without using the primer.  i'll save the primer review for that product.

what i like is that:
1.  there is no clumping.
2.  length of lashes is increased easily by applying additional coats.
3.  lashes really don't come off unless i use water and rub the lashes off.  thus, neither rubbing only nor water only will remove these lashes.
4.  i don't need makeup remover to remove these lashes like with waterproof mascara.  and waterproof mascara smudges when you rub--these lashes don't smudge--they come right off without pulling out my natural eyelashes.
5.  it doesn't irritate my eyes, skin, or hurt my natural eyelashes.
6.  instructions say don't put on any moisturizer, etc., before using the product because that may make it harder for the product to stay on.  well, i do use my eye cream first, and i wait a few minutes before applying the primer.  so i have not had a problem with the product adhering to my lashes.  again, this may be because i'm also using the primer first.

also, i use this dark blue color even though i'm african american, my eyes are brown, and my eyelashes "appear to be naturally black."  i read somewhere that the dark blue color really makes brown eyes "pop."  i was concerned about the color, but now that i have worn it, i will never purchase black mascara again.  as an african american, it was important to me that my eyelashes add something more than just length.  the dark blue color does appear to be black from far away.  people notice it's dark blue when you're up close and especially when your eyes are wet.  gosh, i look good wearing this color, and whoever said the color would make my eyes "pop" was right.

i have no "dislikes" for this product.  i really cannot find enough great things to say.  it's worth every penny.  and when you start wearing this product, your friends will ask you what you have on your eyes.  the next comment is typically "oh i'm going to have to steal that"--:).  so you know it looks good on!",2014-06-26,5,5,AQ5WRR4MS98YZ,B002A9JONI

i, too, was worried that my eyelashes were falling out when i washed my face at night, but it's just the "tubules" falling off.  tiny tubules at that.  also, while i have never had any problem with any beauty product in the past, and i am closer to fifty years old than any other milestone, i have irritated eyes since wearing this mascara.  my eyes feel gunky and watery, almost like there's an allergy.

(i don't use waterproof mascara because it's too hard on your lashes) i've even put blinc up again sephora's deluxe mascara sampler. which includes 10 of their most popular mascaras (korres, urban decay, smashbox, laura mercier..etc.) blinc outlasts them all. there's almost no flaking and it only smears if i put my eyecream on too heavy. i solved that problem by using the heavier eyecream before bed and getting a lighter one for morning.",2010-05-05,5,5,AEQW4I82Z5LR4,B002A9JONI
3201,"i had high hopes for this mascara, based on all the glowing reviews.  on the positive side, it absolutely comes off completely with water and a little pressure.  (however, to quibble a bit, it doesn't slide off in "tubes"--it comes off in stringy clumps, like melted plastic.)

now on to the negatives.  i have long, thick lashes, and this mascara makes them look very thin.  it adds no volume at all, but rather makes them look spikey.  by the end of the day, my lashes are no longer smooth, but are bent at weird angles.  and i have flakes under my eyes.  not only that, but you can't add more mascara once it has dried.  so if you've done your makeup in the am and want to oomph up your mascara before you go out after work, you can't.

i bought a tube of this for my youngest daughter, because she likes waterproof/water resistant mascara, but always struggled with removal.  with kiss me she can simply get her mascara off in the shower.  but i don't think it does much as far as adding any lash drama, and she does get some flaking.

all in all, unless ease of removal is your biggest concern, i wouldn't recommend this mascara, especially at the $20+ price.",2010-04-07,2,3,A2OW1FKQFPIA5D,B002A9JONI

like all dermblend products, you want to begin very lightly. so, if you are using this for under your eyes, go lightly. then use a beauty blender or brush. then apply your foundation. then dust on (or pat on) a layer of translucent powder. if you still see slight "circles," try just a touch more of this stick next time. you do not want to over-apply. by adding very slowly and blending very carefully, you should be able to achieve a truly natural look.

3239,"my tan-complection filipina wife loves dermablend.

she has many different tones on her face and body, so she has several different shades she uses rather than trying to make everything the same color.  it turns out fantastic the way she does it.  i wish i could put a video up of her before, applying and after.  i've never seen any of her make-ups come out so well... plus it has a helpful spf to keep her from getting darker (yes she gets darker with sun exposure).

she's had a zit problem ever since arriving in the usa and has tried many products to stop them.  the only thing that has worked was going back to philippines for 3 months.  we have no idea if it's something in the ingredients of something she eats here, or some sort of spray on the vegetables... but she hides it when she wants to look really nice with an application of dermablend products.

she has 5 different creams, a couple of powders and 2 sticks, varying shades of tan.  she can apply them very quickly now, but of course had to study them carefully for what worked where and such.  i'm pleased that dermablend is available for people like her, though it's a little expensive for the amount you get (my frugal opinion).

she's worth it!

afternote:  i asked her to read over some of the one star reviews from people who were not happy with the results and she could only say maybe they don't clean their face properly and that they should watch some of the zillion youtube tutorials.",2017-07-14,5,5,A2OR94VN7XQCUO,B002HG7NX2

it definitely covers dark circles well and doesn't patch up around the eyes, which is another big  attribute. after proper application, the product lasts long and wears well for hours. my only concern, thus, the one missing star, is although i've had no breakouts or irritation from the brand, my face, where i apply the product, feels a bit slicker than the rest of my face. of course, everyone is different and will experience different results.",2017-07-12,4,4,A1NXA6Y1T9XDUM,B002HG7NX2

8. loreal dermablend quick-fix concealer stick (spf 30)

i have been using loreal products since the 1980s when my best friend was wearing a frosted lipstick i liked and i later sought out.  it smelled good too. it was a truer color in my eyes, since many comparable brands were putting red tinges into the light pinks and such.  also, some of the loreal colors of lipsticks and eyeshadows were pearly, and i liked them because they looked very ethereal, as with the pink-violet lipstick that changed colors depending on the light.

i have aged, and my last purchase was a loreal infallible product, one of many in a line which rarely or never need reapplication for my creased lids and bitten lips. i have been so obsessed that i have a whole zipper case full of the eyeshadows alone. i have a lot of products from their visible lift line for my skin texture. i especially enjoyed the blur ones.  now i am going to move on to have more choices in my zip bag.

there has been more exposure with loreal in my experience than i can mention here, including most recently, a lovely reddish-brown shade of eyeshadow that stays put, a super-mascara, another lip paint, some face-tone enhancers, and a creamy-to-dry, light-colored eye light, among others.

i am happy to see more high-end products from loreal that should work well for young and old alike, especially since it seemed to me years ago that their products were for my younger crowd.

1. dermablend professional cover crme with titanium dioxide sunscreen (30spf):
this is the first item in this line of dermablend cosmetics from loreal that ive received, and it is my very favorite.  it covers my skin imperfections well.

my first attempt with it doesnt count, since i spread it very thin, allowing a bit of dermatitis i had at the time to show some dry skin through.  and i went out that night wondering why this was happening.  first of all, i thought i needed to get rid of the rash that was there before reapplying and reviewing this product, and second, i thought i needed to exfoliate since i have sun spots. now i get it.  this particular crme has to be built up gradually for me. and building it up judiciously is not problematic at all.  it is lovely.

if i use a sponge applicator it will ruin one purpose of it for me which is to cover variable imperfections; and when i apply it with dab it appears blended, and i really find out how radiant and thorough a cover cream make-up can be.  it has alone a bit of chroma to it, as does dermablend pro smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation (25 spf),  in my opinion, unlike many other cover products i have used. alone, they gleaming the light more than my other cover make-ups, without chalkiness.  very nice.

the other purpose for me is that it has a (30 spf) sunscreen.  all other cosmetics with sunscreen i have tried have (25 spf) or lower, and not my needed (30 spf) that my dermatologist recommends.  she has said that even in my home with shades closed i am exposing my skin to potential damage.  i score 1,000 % here for this as well as the other qualities of this line.

the two colors i have are both medium ones, one a bit lighter, and both appropriate for me, especially my indulgence of mixing other lighter or darker colored loreal dermablend pro products with them.

ive been feeling a bit like a chemist with the many loreal dermablend pro products listed here. and i realize you may not have this type of a menu, but i am hoping this info will help somehow to see the flexibility here if not anything else.

2. loreal dermablend professional translucent loose setting powder (no spf):
needed. the wonderful crmes i love work nicely with loreal dermablend professional translucent loose setting powder with micronized powder, and hides flaws when that is part of what you are going for.  this particular product is very fine, not grainy, and perhaps a bit creamy.  it definitely blends in well.  it is very nice for creating a thin and matte next barrier, keeping the crme, bases, foundations, from smudging to hands, clothing.  in various ways, i am able to get some creative looks i sought in using them together:

 dermablend pro translucent loose setting powder in my three separate medium shades (separate jars); when applied and then dusted off created light on dark or dark on light look as i so chose. a. what i mean is that with the lighter shade of crme i was able to get the same look with the darker powder, as with the opposite of that technique using the darker crme and a lighter powder. altogether, with these medium shades i was able to get a perfect match, thus prolonging my experience.  b. also, with the white translucent powder i have found that i am getting a more dimensional look by applying the light shade powder on certain areas of my face, and on top or around in certain areas like cheeks, nose, chin, forehead, i will carefully apply and lightly dust the medium-toned translucent powders as described, allowing it to not look quite so much like monotone matte over my sallow complexion.  another plus 1,000 for me.

i have found recently that i need to put on fine dustings of all powders for myself.
pick your poison, as i have purchased some powder and crme blushes before today; though you may find it unnecessary if you want the dimensional yet minimalist look.

i like to play with the powders, yet, when i am in a rush i will make errors, not being subtle, and not dusting before other products.  also, i am 62, and my baggy under-eye application errors are the most noticeable. i get rid of this bagginess first.  i will use the powders now, especially with other lighter dermablend crme applications, or with the high-quality dermablend pro smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation (25 spf) listed below; and as well as their other foundations. all definitely for photos where a shine or two really counts.
one thing that helps give a nice touch over the powders and such is the loreal dermablend professional set + refresh long-lasting make-up setting spray. the powders are probably quite wonderful for an oily skin type, for example; they are nice for a youthful complexion; and i believe they are going to look quite radiant on a woman with less-noticeable pores, and without wrinkle issues along with age and skin texture combined.  in my case i am fine, and safest when i am well-rested.

3. loreal dermablend professional set + refresh long-lasting make-up setting spray (no spf):
these dermablend base products are synergistically enhanced with a nice sheen of fresh with a spray application of loreal dermablend professional set + refresh long-lasting make-up setting spray. just lightly mist your face with your hair pulled back to enhance your look and seal your make-up applications.  even with dusted powders it will make a difference.  it is that simple.

4. loreal dermablend professional smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation!! (25 spf):
this a product that i had underestimated until today when i applied it under dermablend pro translucent loose setting powder, which may not be necessary if you want that chroma look; yet because i preferred the variable built-up applications i achieved with the dermablend professional crme, i missed something with trying this last.  as before i was too quick to judge.  i had applied it very thick and then i went out.  i thought to myself that is was mask-like, yet nice moist cover.

not only can i variably apply this creamier product to cover the face and problem areas with my fingers, i can also use a sponge blender for a more airbrushed look, then applying more product to the flaws. this shade is a tad darker than the other shades of make-ups, so as with the crme, and the powders, i may experiment with altering the look as in 2a.  win-win-win.  i also may add a finishing touch of the dermablend professional set + refresh long-lasting make-up setting spray for a fresh stay; with or without powders.

5. loreal dermablend professional intense powdercamo!! (no spf):
this is a lovely and creamy intense powder in a nice mirrored compact with a sponge applicator, in other compartments.  while this color is quite dark for me, one quality, besides the products ability to render a thin cover layer, is that i do not see wrinkles really.  maybe the thin layer or the creaminess?  and the staying power, especially with the fresh mist of loreal dermablend professional set + refresh long-lasting make-up setting spray.  also, i can dab and smooth this powder wherever i want to whatever area of the face or neck.  the darker color, applied gently is making a nice bronzer.  i do know that is stretching it. i haven't tried it over the above loreal dermablend professional liquid camo product, since this is a very dark color; however, i am sure this might possibly work; though this does go on thin, and i do not think a crme or foundation is needed to get a good look. very nice camo cover product!

6. loreal dermablend professional quick-fix body!! (no spf):
wow again.  i hadnt understood at first how i can use this, as one of the colors i own is a darker bronze; and while i hadnt yet noticed the medium (my shade).  i mistakenly applied some of the dark under my cheekbones to see a defined look which actually worked for me, yet thick as i applied it - and silly me! i am thinking that since this product says body in the title it is going to be nice for use on varicose veins and other body imperfections like a permanent rash i have!  double win!

this is a creamy roll-up stick cover product which does the job, and which i won't feel shy about adding puffs of dermablend professional translucent setting powder so it doesnt rub off; and i will use the appropriate color powder as well as described above in 2a.  this is a lovely product.  i love the idea of having a smooth body-skin look as with the generous tube of the wonderful, and long-lasting dermablend professional leg and body make-up; however, im mentioning this first as im partial to a more natural, yet youthful, less unsightly look.  it isn't quite going to be looking as flawlessly airbrushed as the full body make-up, yet it is the product i will use first; especially during the day. love.

7. loreal dermablend professional leg and body make-up (spf25):
it is so nice to wear tights, stockings, or nylons during the winter to have confidence that leg imperfections will not be seen with dresses, and on ankles under pants above boots.  however, during cooler months especially, it is very nice to see perfect body skin peeking out of your clothing.  not only does this product render a flawless airbrushed look, it is actually very resistant to liquid or rubbing off onto hands or clothing.  i absolutely loved the look when i put it on; and then darn, i was noticing in the light that my shade was a bit peachier than my actual sallow skin.  this might not be problematic for you with full-body applications, as for me on an occasional basis as desired; yet finding your closest match will save you a lot of bother, and will please you i believe.  as i have expressed that this product renders a nice, airbrushed look, and i believe even because of the staying power alone this dermablend pro product is worth looking into.

8. loreal dermablend quick-fix concealer stick (spf 30)
this works fabulously; it is creamy and it stays put; it is smart just as the loreal dermablend professional cover crme, because it has that strength of sunscreen that my dermatologist recommends, even as i am in my home, shades drawn.  it covers very well, looks flawless with or without other products, yet it works synergistically with the wonderful loreal dermablend pro line. i have it in a tan color, and i would have thought since i usually use lighter shades of concealers that it would not have looked so perfect with my medium skin. lovely. plus 1,000, and very smart.

very nice products indeed.  enjoy!

the loreal dermablend professional line of cosmetics is new to me.  they earn being in a high-end category in my opinion. they do not seem to be scented or too chemical. the jars, tubes, compacts are made very sturdy to last along with your make-ups. i have many favorites among them, yet i believe they all stand very well on their own.

i hope it is going to be efficient to review all of the ones i know of here, and including compatible products along the way. respectively:

i have been using loreal products since the 1980s when my best friend was wearing a frosted lipstick i liked and i later sought out.  it smelled good too. it was a truer color in my eyes, since many comparable brands were putting red tinges into the light pinks and such.  also, some of the loreal colors of lipsticks and eyeshadows were pearly, and i liked them because they looked very ethereal, as with the pink-violet lipstick that changed colors depending on the light.
i have aged, and my last purchase was a loreal infallible product, one of many in a line which rarely or never need reapplication for my creased lids and bitten lips. i have been so obsessed that i have a whole zipper case full of the eyeshadows alone. i have a lot of products from their visible lift line for my skin texture. i especially enjoyed the blur ones.  now i am going to move on to have more choices in my zip bag.
there has been more exposure with loreal in my experience than i can mention here, including most recently, a lovely reddish-brown shade of eyeshadow that stays put, a super-mascara, another lip paint, some face-tone enhancers, and a creamy-to-dry, light-colored eye light, among others.
i am happy to see more high-end products from loreal that should work well for young and old alike, especially since it seemed to me years ago that their products were for my younger crowd.

3261,"this is a review for the dermablend quick-fix concealer for full coverage  stick in three shades:

10c natural
30c light and
10n ivory

if you've never tried dermablend makeup before, know that it's a really quality brand but it is normally made for full coverage - it is heavier makeup meant to really conceal and hide flaws and blemishes and it's not  like a a b&b cream which is my usually choice.

i've had an autoimmune condition for many years that has given me telangiectasis on my upper chest and face (usually referred to as broken blood vessels.) i usually hate the feel of heavy foundations and concealers but if i go out somewhere like a party or where i am going to have my picture taken, i prefer to have them covered up.

 dermablend has really been a great answer for my issues, and it has been recommended by dermatologists and cosmetic surgeons for years as one of the few (if only) makeups that can cover blue/yellow/red bruises and real discolorations  - not just the occasional blemish,

i have used their foundations before and reviewed those separately, but am now reviewing these three quick-fix sticks. and, i said in my dermablend foundation review, it is just so hard to pick out any makeup - especially a foundation or a concealer - without actually going in person and trying it on to see if it blends with your face.

saying that, i can review the quality of the makeup. in this case, i found these concealer sticks good, albeit you have to use a little more than i'd like to cover up the discoloration; one quick swipe of the stick didn't do it.  personally, i use a little bit of the stick and then use one of their powders over it and that really helps correct the problem.

my particular coloring is rather pale with sort of an olive tone - i have dark hair and light skin. i thought the best stick for me of the three was the lightest, the ivory, which surprised me. the other two sticks weren't bad but light 30c had a tiny bit too much pinkish for me, and the 10n just a tad too yellow.

again, the trick is to find the right color, and i think that's really hard to do online. i do recommend the dermablend makeup brand if you're looking for makeup that really covers. do be careful if you have older skin; the heavier concealers and makeup can add years even if they do cover up discolorations so take that into consideration too.",2017-07-03,4,3,A2GPJR489OIH42,B002HG7NX2

now that its winter i am noticing that this conceler is drying my skin out. i tried mixing it with face oils and using richer moisturizer before etc but i am still noticing the dry patches. docking a star down.**

its awesome!! its true to color and its pigmented so a little goes a long way. i have some dark circles and this helps cover it pretty well. i cannot say that is true for many of the name brand concealers i've tried over the years. this product has humbled many!!

i simply moisturize my face, glide the concealer under the eye and blend it with my fingers or a wet beauty blender and use a foundation after. it does make a huge difference. it is also economically prized.

i love it and would recommend this to everyone!",2017-07-03,4,5,AACR8PZRSFG3J,B002HG7NX2

3265,"overall this is a very good concealer.  it does blend in slightly lighter than i expected.  the tan - to  me - goes on almost like a lighter shade, say ivory.

it does cover decently, including dark circles under eyes, although i think if it had slightly more pigment it would work a bit better.  the skin tone in my family is fair so i assumed the lightest shade would be best but we will buy medium next time and see how that goes.

i don't fault dermablend for that, and while not a huge fan of their products this one is good.  i usually find their stuff overpriced and requiring too many steps - drying, setting powder etc.

application is simple, treat it somewhat like a lipstick and dab or stroke it gently onto your skin.

all in all a good concealer once you find the right shade.",2017-07-02,4,4,A3T4OHEAHOJ700,B002HG7NX2
3266,"i've been using this for my under eyes which have some darkness to them sometimes, probably caused by lack of sleep. it goes on easily, blends in well and although it doesn't completely hide the darkness it definitely makes a noticeable difference. additionally i do have somewhat sensitive skin and there was no irritation or eye discomfort after applying.  the reason i hesitate giving it more than 3 stars is due to the pricing and results.  i myself have similar products that i have purchased for less than half the price on this and they work just as well, if not slightly better. because of that i find it hard to say that you would be getting a good value for the current selling price.",2017-07-02,3,3,A353U0L2HAMSHV,B002HG7NX2

3269,"i was eager to try this product, as i've heard nothing but praise for dermablend products over the years.  this worked well as a concealer, but was a bit heavier than i would prefer for everyday use.  it also seemed a little greasier than other concealers i have used on my undereye area, and as a result, my eye makeup was more easily smudged.  it is very creamy and easy to blend.  it would probably be best for someone looking for good opacity and heavy coverage, rather than someone going for a natural look.  i think the smudging issue would be alleviated with a little powder, but that's more makeup than i prefer to wear on a daily basis.",2017-07-01,3,4,A2HOLM5I1ARX9J,B002HG7NX2

3272,"perfect for covering up the circles under your eyes. this gives a generous amount of coverage, getting rid of the darkness easily. the coverage goes on smooth without need for a ton of blending. keep in mind to go a little bit lighter if you're using it under your eyes. highlights the area so you don't look dead and the same color everywhere. i like the nice dewey look it leaves behind. it does not appear to be dry or cakey. love it",2017-06-30,5,5,A1VXIY1511XQK2,B002HG7NX2
3273,"i am a huge dermablend fan.  having struggled with blemishes my whole life, and still buying acne stuff though i'm now on medicare, i know my cover-ups and concealers, and for my money, there is no better line than dermablend.

so many concealers fail to conceal.  so many don't adhere if one's skin is even slightly oily.  so many disappear as soon as one's skin gets moist.

none of these things is true of this concealer.  it covers red places and other discoloration completely, regardless of how moist and/or oily your skin is, and it stays there, continuing to conceal for hours.  i usually use a light powder over my foundations and concealers, so that may help it have staying power, but i don't doubt it would be long-lasting even without the powder.

five stars.",2017-06-30,5,5,A2HZ3Z494VS1KG,B002HG7NX2
3274,"the concealer arrived last week when the temperature was 105.  although it was packed well, it arrived warm and the tip of it was starting to melt.  i placed it in the frig overnight and have been using it.  it is very soft, slides on smoothly, and covers reasonably well.

because i cannot determine accurately if the consistency or covering ability has been affected by the heat,  i rate it a three, not five.  i do not recommend carrying  it in your purse during hot weather, as it appears frail, not at all hard.

3280,"finding the perfect concealer to mask dark undereye circles is something like the quest for the holy grail.  in my experience, covering discrete dark areas (like a blemish or a tattoo) is relatively easy, while it's extremely difficult to achieve a natural look concealing the amorphous area under the eye.

over the  years, i've tried professional cover-up in pots (limelight by alcone), drugstore brands with sponge applicators (cover girl invisible concealer) and department store brands in tubes (clinique advance concealer) with about the same results.  lately, i've been using bare minerals correcting concealer light 1, which comes in a small pot and must be applied with a fingertip.  it works well enough, but application is a bit of a pain and the color does not quite match my fair sallow skintone.

i was very pleasantly surprised by the dermablend quick-fix (in shade 30c - light) because it's densely pigmented, super easy to apply, blends seamlessly and doesn't settle into the creases.  the color has a slight yellow/neutral undertone that matches my skin perfectly and doesn't create that dreaded overly white "reverse raccoon" eye.  i really like the stick applicator which is sized and shaped perfectly for the undereye area.

one thing i should add, if you don't set with powder (which i avoid because i'm over 50), you'll need to re-apply midday, but other than that, this really is a wonderful product.",2017-06-28,5,5,A1Y7C52533BA2H,B002HG7NX2
3281,"the vine program offered me the "deep" color of this concealer stick. i ordered it with no point of reference as to how dark "deep" really was. as it turns out, it's a milk chocolate brown which is a bit darker than what i needed. i think a shade or two lighter would have been a better match for me. still, i was able to get coverage of a burn scar that i have on the upper part of my hand which, right now, is pretty tan. (i'd never be able to use it in winter). i also tried it on a bruise that was sort of fading to yellow, on an old wound on my arm that has faded but is pink with no skin pigment. in all cases, the underlying problem was disguised and alleviated, but there was definitely a color mis-match. none of the defects completely disappeared, but all were softened to some extent.

the product is easy to apply. you don't need very much, just dab lightly and spread, dab again if necessary. it really spreads very nicely and the edges blend and disappear. my scar is light and a little bit raised and i have some dark veins nearby which i also covered. it did a pretty good job with the color blending but what is raised, still looks raised. (i imagine that, what is pitted will still look pitted).

i wasn't able to use the product on the scar i really wanted to use it on. i have an ugly surgical scar below my right clavicle. it has areas that are pink, white, purple, and it has texture and an irregular shape. part of it shows when i wear a v-neck. judging from how well the product disguises the burn on my hand, i think that--if i'd had the correct color for my skin--this scar might have been well-concealed.

however, there is the problem that the product stains the fabric and it's very difficult to remove. so, for a scar or other feature that will be touching fabric, this is not a good choice. it's probably quite good for areas on the face, hands, upper arms, etc. assuming you have a good color match to your skin color. but be careful with having it come in contact with fabric.

i would have a hard time recommending what shade to get. judging from the way the scar on my hand was covered up, i figure you need to get a slightly darker color than your natural skin color. i think getting a slightly lighter color might be counter productive. but i wish the manufacturer would post color swatches on the amazon listing and make an informed recommendation of which way to go when in doubt. given the cost of the product, i think the customer deserves a little guidance.",2017-06-28,3,3,A2VWE5SGNDS8HW,B002HG7NX2

i found this to be okay for minimal imperfections or for light details that you'd want to cover up. if it's a small freckle or beauty mark, then it does wonders, but for a scar or blemish mark, it doesn't really offer adequate long-lasting coverage like some of my other concealers. in order to have consistent coverage, i would have to keep reapplying this throughout the day.",2017-06-27,3,3,AZQKNX6F8S84Q,B002HG7NX2

first, the lipstick style tube makes it extremely easy to apply the concealer  but don't press too hard or you may get more than you bargained for. that said, even this light shade covers well, but perhaps too well  my spouse said it looked like i had a black eye. on the other hand, i received a compliment at work, and i thought i looked good, so maybe it just needed to sink in.

this product has spf 30 in it, so be sure to also apply sunscreen to the rest of your face or you will have tan and not-tan spots after a day in the sun.",2017-06-19,5,4,AEC90GPFKLAAW,B002HG7NX2
3334,"okay, i'm amazed at how long this concealer has lasted on my face today.  this was day 1 for me for this brand, and it went on nicely, covering my few age spots, and around my eyes.  i have redness around my eyes caused by years of glaucoma (drops), plus pronounced darker semi-circles under the eyes.  i patted on the ivory color (perfect color for my very fair skin) and it actually worked to conceal.  the semi-circles were still there, just not as dark, and the redness was not noticeable, and the age spots/blemishes all but disappeared. i think it has held up rather well, even without the setting powder.  after applying, i put on dermablend cover creme and their intense powder camo, dry, plus some of my blush to finish the look.  my face has looked great all day, and not cakey or looking like it was put on with a trowel!  the best part for me is that this company is part of l'oreal,the company that makes my favorite makeup products.",2017-06-18,5,5,A3IR834T7AROBT,B002HG7NX2

(i'm in my 60s, so i don't expect any product to give me back the skin i had in my 20s.) i use my finger to put it on, blend it in, then set it by powdering my face. you could also use a small makeup brush to apply it. it's in a lipstick-type tube instead of a bottle with a brush like the other concealers i've used. when the weather is hot -- which it often is in south texas -- i apply it in the morning and then again in the afternoon or evening if i'm going to be out and about. it has no fragrance. it's not the cheapest product on the market, but it gets the job done.",2017-06-17,4,4,A1P77JG6PMRRPK,B002HG7NX2

3341,"i ordered the caramel, and let me tell you there is nothing caramel about the color. it's beige. this is one of the problems i have with buying non-african-american make-up products--many rarely get the colors right as we come in an array of colors. it's very hard purchasing our products online as we have to actually be somewhere that we can actually test the product before we buy it.

needless to say this product was too light and didn't have any brown pigments in it. it did eventually blend in when i applied darker foundation, and it set well when i used the translucent concealing powder, but it took some time to blend it.

it did last all day, but honestly, i can't tell if it was the concealer or the foundation that i mixed in with it. i will try a darker color and pray it's not too dark.",2017-06-17,3,3,A1501C38OCSEMA,B002HG7NX2

3343,"this brand has always been the gold standard for make-up products with superior coverage that can be used to hide everything from scars, tattoos, birthmarks, dark circles and discolorations from age spots to bruises. my skin tone is medium light and the medium 35c shade is a good match.

the texture is thick but a thin coat still goes on smoothly. after applying i use a cotton swab to feather the edges which with the proper shade selected, makes the transition between the product and skin almost undetectable.

the instructions state that to achieve the longest wear, use a setting powder after application, wait two minutes and brush off the excess. i did not apply powder but even without it the concealer remained in place for easily twelve hours before removed with make-up wipes.

dermatologist, ophthalmologist and allergy tested, the concealer also does not clog pores, is spf30 and is unscented. it did not cause irritation, wears well and a light coat does not cake-up. reliable coverage, very pleased with performance..",2017-06-16,5,4,A35Q0RBM3YNQNF,B002HG7NX2

finding the right shade is really tough. i am fair and their light colors are pinky on my skin and the yellow tones are way too yellow. i use a high end powder from another line and once i get this in the right place i cover then with powder. it does crack if you make it thick. it also looks thick if your skin is oily a while after you put it on. the great thig is it does not irritate or break me out. i rate it highly because of that. this particular tube ( bought two) was a little dried so i may be hesitant to order here again.  it does cover very well, as well as anything i have ever found but not sure about scars or tatoos. i apply a base first and it smooths my pores pretty good too.",2015-02-14,4,5,AE76U8LPKIO20,B002HG7NX2

3358,"i have nc15, adult, oily, acne prone skin. the ivory color was an ok match, though this brand tends to be tricky when it comes to choosing the right shade. later in the day, it can appear slightly yellow. that's a problem for me, because it wear only concealer and powder, so it needs to be a near perfect match for my skin color.

this concealer does offer medium coverage. when used under the eyes, though, it creases, and when used on blemishes, i have to layer it a little to make it stick. patting with fingers is probably the best way to apply it, but it slides off your face if you pat too much. layering more than one swipe can make it appear cakey, and it separates later in the day, even with a setting powder.

the thickness and oiliness of this product makes me wary, since these types of stick concealers tend to make breakouts worse. but i didn't experience any adverse reactions or immediate breakouts.

overall, for the price this isn't a truly unique product. i couldn't find a good use for it, or a good way to apply it, and it even looked oily in the package. it offers more coverage than most drugstore stick concealers, but for the money you could get 2-3 liquid concealers at the drugstore that would perform better. not the greatest, and not the worst product. just not worth $22.",2014-07-08,3,2,A16UO065RCHCGW,B002HG7NX2

3468,"i have purchased a number (5) of vinylux products--and this is one that has given me nothing but trouble.
first off, i'll admit that i'm not a nail professional. but i did my own gel nails for 8 years (until the primer caused an allergic reaction) and i do my own cnd shellac nails. so i think i'm pretty careful and "professional" in my application of products.

that being said, i have had such poor results with this color -- it is streaky and difficult to get to an even, smooth color. (there is no way you could use the "two thin coats" that the instructions suggest--you would just have streaky, half-see-through color). then when i get it looking ok, it chips off within one day. i have problems with the others colors really staying good for more than a week (much less than advertised), and it may be that because this is so dark, the chips are especially noticeable. i love the color -- but i just don't want to hassle with trying to get it to last more than a day. i have tried applying the polish exactly as instructed, tried using the top coat as a base coat, tried curing it with a uv light, applying it super thin, and applying it thicker--but it always fails. (yes, i do seal the edge.)

 also, this color stains!! my nails are a terrible orang-y color after using this for 2 weeks (numerous applications).

while vinylux is much easier to remove than shellac, it doesn't wear nearly as long -- i just can't decide if it's worth using either.",2013-11-07,1,1,A3SN8H1V126IIY,B002K6AHQY
3469,"i love the vinylux polishes. they definitely have lasting power!!! i wash my hands dozens of times per day and normal polish chips the same day i put it on! the vinylux lasts about a week for me, which is amazing. some of the polishes are a little clumpy - like they are a little old - but it's ok. decent price too!",2013-10-30,5,5,ATZDGPMWR6N5D,B002K6AHQY

3471,"vinylux is a great companion product to cnd's shellac system, especially since many of shellac's colors are duplicated in the vinylux line.  purple purple is my favorite color for pedicures, but since the shellac removal procedure is a major pain for toenails, i especially wanted vinylux for toes. toenails grow more slowly, so the "grow-out line" takes longer to appear.  we all know a pedicure lasts way longer than a mani because toenails don't get the use and wear that fingernails do, so vinylux is perfect, as it goes on easily and removes faster than shellac.  some have said that vinylux loses some shine over time, but i have not seen that effect at all.  my current pedicure is almost a month old and there are zero chips.",2013-09-23,5,5,AYB2RR9WW2OVR,B002K6AHQY

i have had my fair share of facial products that do nothing but either irritate or dry out my skin (ha, i think if i tried to smile i would have not been able to).

the product is gentle on the skin and i can use it as the main facial wash instead of having one for the morning and one at night (yes, some people might wonder why would anyone do that, but if i purchase a product i do not have the money to be wasting so i have to use it).

when my niece came over, i asked her to try the product as well and she like it.  being a teenager, her skin tends to have more issues than  mine so i would think this is a product that might work for teenagers with breakouts.

i like being able to dispense just enough instead of squeezing product out and applying too much pressure and ending up with too much product and not being able to place the excess back in the container.

the bottle is big, i have had this for over a month and it is barely halfway (daily use).  depending on how much you dispense, it might last longer.",2017-05-01,5,3,A93GW5XX51MAP,B002P3L99G

since i began using this product i no longer need the addition of the benzoyl peroxide in my daily routine. my skin is fresh looking but without oiliness. it also appears more clear - no blemishes or blackheads. and the fragrance of the cleanser is wonderful. it smells like lemon and lilacs...

the soap foams really well and has a very pleasant mild scent. the name may be a little bit misleafing since it it doesn't have a foam dispenser. overall, it cleans really well and is very affordable for such an excellent quality product.

it does a fairly good job of clearing up her facial infections and oily skin. although she continues to have oily skin afterwards, theres not much that can stop that except accutane, a very risky product, especially birth defects. my oldest daughter went through the accutane procedure against my strongest objections. my wife has been using this this day and night so she can see a better result.  its going to take some time, but she is reasonably convinced this product will stop the pimples from escalating.  there are a lot of highly rated reviews, so thats also reassuring to her that she is on the right track.

i saw the fluid ounces, but i didn't quite expect it to be as big as it is  and thats good. a lot of these products charge high prices for very small amounts and usually barely work. this effaclar cleanser at $20 still isn't cheap, but at least you get a reasonable amount of it and it is definitely effective. i'm glad to have gotten it via the vine program because i might not have purchased it otherwise. we've been down a lot of wrong roads with bold claims and even good reviews prior to this product.  at least this way i know what i'm getting and i will definitely buy more when this bottle is depleted.",2017-03-13,5,5,A2AF0NOCM71J0B,B002P3L99G
3482,"i have extremely sensitive skin and chemical sensitivities and i'm happy to say this cleanser did not bother me at all.  it does have a slight scent and normally i can't tolerate any smells in my soaps but this one caused me no trouble.  it is a thicker gel and you just lather and use to clean your face.  it doesn't leave your face feeling stripped yet it feels clean and looks great after use.  i had to use a washcloth because it doesn't just splash right off.  remember it's a gel and it has the consistency of such on your face.  it says it's for oily skin so i thought would be more drying but it is not so at all.  i'm quite happy with it thus far.",2017-03-13,5,5,AJ9AE2BVND0GS,B002P3L99G

the thing i didn't like about this cleanser was the chemical smell. maybe it's the zinc or some other ingredient, but when i used this i could smell a chemical smell which surprised me since i was expecting a gentle cleanser. i also became concerned that i didn't want to get this stuff in my eyes as i lathered up my face. it may be an ok face wash, but for me, the ingredients and the smell seemed too harsh.",2017-03-10,3,3,A1FPQ54AIB26L0,B002P3L99G

3485,"this is a good cleanser.  though it is billed as a product for people with oily skin, my experience is that it works well even for those whose skin is not oily.  it is also a product that has not aggravated allergies and skin sensitivities.

my one somewhat negative observation?  the pump never worked.  perhaps it arrived broken in some way; perhaps it is not well designed.  i can't say.  but i had to find another bottle with a working pump.",2017-03-08,5,4,A3JV4PJZD5O4NJ,B002P3L99G
3486,"this cleanser is working very well for me, outside of the first time when i had a few 'eruptions' happen, i'm guessing it came from unclogging a couple of pores since it hasn't happened since the first use. i don't pick up on any strong fragrance (a plus for me) and it cleans what little makeup i do wear with no irritations to my irritable skin. this is also a very generous size bottle of cleanser, much larger than i expected. my only complaint is the condition the dispenser was in when it arrived, and it is possible i broke it when trying to break open the heavy bubble wrap and heavy tape it arrived in. when i got it all open, the very top part of the dispenser was loose from the rest, and while i was able to get it back into the dispenser and use it, it doesn't connect solidly and is easy loosened when grabbing the bottle. again, it could have been myself who did it, as i didn't examine it closely through the bubble wrap, but it is the first time this has happened with any products with this kind of dispenser unit. still, i'm very happy with how it's working on my skin and won't be switching back to my old standby anytime soon.",2017-03-05,4,5,A2F540P3L6P5CL,B002P3L99G

 but first i wash my face with a sugar cleanser , as i feel that is exfoliating .
then i use this purifying gel..my face feels clean, and softer then it has felt in a long time.
the foaming gel has a wonderful scent to it, and has not caused my face to break out.
 that said i have used it by it self, and my face does feel soft, but i feel the sugar wash adds a little something extra .

this is a good sized bottle.  since you don't need to use very much to thoroughly cleanse your face, it should last a respectable amount of time (in a single-user scenario).",2017-03-04,5,5,A3IUW081KXD3PE,B002P3L99G

fyi: this cleanser in itself isn't a strong acne fighting product. it has zinc to help combat oiliness, but i would consider it a complement to an effective acne-fighting regimen (effaclar duo is my top choice). this cleanser is also great for people who simply have oily skin.",2017-01-11,5,5,A3HZ687GB0AH7Y,B002P3L99G

3512,"la roche-posay effaclar purifying foaming gel cleanser is excellent. this clear foaming gel cleanser is for "oily sensitive skin" and is free of soap, alcohol, oil and parabens. this gel cleanser does have light fragrance, though it doesn't irritate my skin or aggravate my allergies. the effaclar line of products are formulated for sensitive oily or acne prone skin. still, i use effaclar clarifying oil free towelettes and they agree perfectly with my sensitive skin even though it's dry instead of oily. i've been trying the gel cleanser even though my skin is sensitive but not oily, and my teen with sensitive oily skin and also moderate acne has also been using it. as it turns out, it actually works quite well for both of us despite our different skin types.

for my teen, this cleansing gel works especially well. it's definitely more gentle, yet seems more effective, than the orange oil free wash recommended by his dermatologist. that one overly dries out his skin but never seems to help minimize or get rid of his acne. instead, after washing his face, his acne always looks more red and inflamed. since using the effaclar gel cleanser, his acne looks calmer and not as inflamed, he hasn't been breaking out and his skin feels is less dry and feels softer. this effaclar gel cleanser (with zinc pca) seems to deep clean his skin without being so harsh. only time will tell how well it helps his acne, but we're really pleased so far, and he's going to continue to use it daily instead of the other brand.

for me, although my sensitive skin tends to be dry, this gel cleanser still feels gentle and leaves my skin really clean and refreshed without being irritated or feeling tight or too dry. i normally use la roche-posay pigmentclar brightening cleanser (or one of my other creamy cleansers), and as a matter of preference think a creamy anti aging cleanser is a better match for my skin type. still, i'll use the effaclar gel cleanser periodically to clarify my skin as it seems to get rid of residual impurities from my makeup, pollution, other skin care products, etc. i think this effaclar gel cleanser is a winner, especially for those with sensitive oily skin.",2016-12-22,5,3,A2L6BT1PVV9YN0,B002P3L99G

as far as use of the product? i enjoyed the marine/oceanic scent. it has a great foaming lather and only about a quarter  size was necessary to cleanse my entire face. it is ph balanced to handle sensitive skin and did not bother my rosacea at all. no irritation whatsoever and it got the job done efficiently, i was able to apply my daily moisturizer after using this product with no leftover residue or buildup from the cleanser. great product at a great price! good value!",2016-12-21,5,5,A2Z8B2KA8K07DM,B002P3L99G

the skin around the eyes is the thinnest on the face and can be most prone to damage and showing the sign of aging. when applying tthe cream carefully under the eye, using the ring finger because it has the lightest touch, you are less likely to harm the delicate area.  after a month of using the cream and following the recommendations, i can say that i saw absolutely no visible reduction of lines under and around  my eyes.  as someone who is over the age of  40, having an emollient rich under eye cream is important to me - especially during colder winter months when the skin requires more moisture.",2015-11-20,3,5,A3RZOPQ42Q50B1,B0038CS02W

needless to say i'm very, very pleased with this eye cream, and will be adding more la roche-posay products to my anti=aging arsenal.",2015-10-31,5,5,A1LINA8MCSONQL,B0038CS02W
3578,"the first two things i noticed when applying this eye cream were: the cream felt velvety smooth & that it had a bite to it.  the bite, or burn if you will was not severe but was very unexpected.  it went away almost as fast as it came on.  aside from that oddity i have experienced no negative side effects.  for about two weeks i only used this on one of my eyes to see if there was a difference.  when i became convinced that i was in fact seeing a very very slight improvement; plumper fuller looking skin around my aging eye, i decided to start using it on both eyes.  again, on the other eye at the first application i experienced the burning, but again it went away within mere moments.
this eye cream feels absolutely wonderful in comparison to my other brand which went on very "wet" aka watery & thin.  my highly sensitive skin while prone to breaking out is also prone to dryness.  this makes things pretty frustrating, but when it comes to the thin delicate skin around my eyes, the more moisturizing the better.
i expect this will last a very long time, as only the teeniest amount is needed, making the price seem more realistic.  i'm thinking this should easily last me a year or longer.  i will be sure to update my review if i feel there is anything relevant to report - good or bad.  as it things stand now i'm very happy with this eye cream.",2015-10-30,5,5,A1RLP0R1N8H8C4,B0038CS02W

i like that it is in an air-tight, opaque tube with a tiny tip. i can dispense just as little as i want, and the rest stays fresh and uncontaminated. pro tip: you need to unscrew the tip the first time, invert it and press in to puncture the foil seal. if there were instructions on how to do this, i missed them.",2015-10-29,5,5,A2KUUIJ52MWDAS,B0038CS02W

 i've used this for a few weeks and haven't really seen any results.  it's a lovely moisturizer, and doesn't irritate my eyes or my lids, which can be pretty finicky about what i use on them.  i don't have any real complaints about it, it's just not doing me any miracles.",2015-10-26,4,3,A2VHQDJBZH0Y7P,B0038CS02W

our initial impression is very good.  this redermic c eyes cream has a soft butter-like viscosity and rubs in very easily. it feels really nice and soothing to apply. a little bit does go a long way. it's hard to really compare these types of cream without long term usage and even then it is difficult. a key test for me personally is whether or not it irritates my very sensitive skin, and i am happy to say that it does not. so far i really like this eye cream better than most that i've tried.

i like that the tube arrives completely and unmistakably sealed.  in order to open it you must first tighten the cap all the way, which seals the nozzle onto the tube and punctures it.

this cream definitely succeeds on the second point.  i haven't had any sensitivity at all from this cream so that is a plus.  but it has had little effect on the wrinkles under my eyes.  i've been using it only on one eye so i can compare it to the other eye (and i haven't been using anything on that eye so it is full wrinkle).  if i really look hard, i might see a little difference, but i doubt that anyone looking at me could tell.  this might be better for younger women whose wrinkles are not as deep as mine.

3591,"i'm a firm believer that in the realm of creams, vitamins, and supplements that what works for one, doesn't not mean that it will work for others.  in that regards i have not noticed a change since beginning to use this la roche-posay product.

i tested it by applying to one eye and to the line between the brows and line next to my mouth.  it is only meant for eyes, but i saw no reason not to give it a wider test range.  the results were invisible to me but i will continue to use it until it is gone.

one of the reasons i can continue to apply is that i haven't experienced any irritation... and i have sensitive old-mom skin.  my skin rebels at the touch of lanolin or baby oil.  it gets painfully dry with most soaps, dry winter heat, and will breakout (ironically since it need the moisture) with many creams/cremes, and lotions.  no reaction to this product which is good since it is used next to the eye.

what you get is a tiny, tiny tube.  but actually it's not as bad as it seems because you don't need to use much.  the product is white and creamy to the touch.  it is slightly oily at first, but after a few minutes it totally gone.  this product is very light.

try it.  it might work for you.  i would be encouraged to experiment because of the lack of irritation. (your results may vary.)",2015-10-22,3,3,AQ6AGWKWMTY8H,B0038CS02W

this is the third product that i have reviewed for this company but i hope it is not the last.  i am really impressed with their improvement of my skin.  i shall continue to use them now that i know they are worth the money they cost.

i don't have the worst wrinkles on my eyelids and under the eyes but i'm probably not far off.  but i am retired, live in a beatiful retirement community but i'm not dead.  i still like to get dressed up for lunch (called dinner here) and fixing my face is more fun than pre-noon tv shows.

i have used expensive and i've used less costly eye creams.  i love the shadows i use (also from amazon) but i do want some kind of beforehand moisture on these old eyes.  this works great!  it's light; not gooey; no fragrance did i notice and shadows go on so smoothly.  i almost feel 70 again!

this might seem a little pricey but the amount you use is minute.  i shall try to keep track of how many days before i have to re-order and i bet it will be at least six months.  that cuts the cost down.  great product.  let's go see what else they make!",2015-10-20,5,5,A368H9GFY1JCYC,B0038CS02W

i see absolutely no changes whatsoever. my eyes look exactly the same, even upon the closest inspection. my skin around my eyes does not feel firmer, the wrinkles are just as pronounced. no change. at the very high price tag, i would think i'd see something. i want to, lord knows i got right up on the mirror and gave it every chance! :d

in my opinion, this is a huge waste of money. i will continue to use this for another two weeks and report back if there is any change.

now as far as the product itself goes, once i was able to get the darn cream out of the tubei finally poked it with a needle to do soi like the color and texture of the product straightaway.

the scent is fabulous, light with a touch of sweetness. ive been using this brand as directed, morning and night, and my skin looks a tad smoother; of course, this could be just because i have a burning expectation for this cream (or any other face cream for that matter!) to work. also, it seems my skin always experiences a positive result with any skin product that contains c. yet again, this could just be psychological. what i am sure of is that my face and neck actually feels tighter since i started using this product. the jury is still out, and i am not sure if la roche-posay redermic c anti-aging care will beat my preferred avon anew brand&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/avon-anew-clinical-advanced-wrinkle-corrector/dp/b0051hqzew/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8">avon anew clinical advanced wrinkle corrector</a>&nbsp;but its pretty close.",2015-11-16,4,5,A1NXA6Y1T9XDUM,B0038COKQ2

this does make a great moisturizer. it dries well, not oily or greasy and your face doesn't feel tight or dry or overly oily. i just didn't notice any major changes. i would be willing to try the whole line of products to see if that made a difference. as is i have the thermal water spray and this, perhaps i should also try a cleanser to keep my face in the same ph and maybe i would see a better result.",2015-11-13,3,3,A89ZZKNDFQH23,B0038COKQ2

3632,"i decided to try this as i was curious about the claim on the front of the box "new re-plumping texture, daily sensitive skin anti-agine fill-in care, anti-wrinkle, firmness, even skin tone, broad spectrum spf 25". wow that promises a lot.

i was curious how they got this approved through the fda and what the active ingredients were to achieve those results. the fda did indeed approve this as a drug, the drug facts on the side of the box show the active ingredients are three sunscreens (avobenzone 3%, octisalate 5%, and octocrylene 7%). it lists the product's uses as a sunscreen and to use it before going in the sun. this is a paraben-free product.

the other side of the box states "for deep wrinkles, loss of firmness and uneven skin tone". these are said to be accomplished by the ingredients vitamin c, mannose to "fade out irregularities by by optimizing the interaction of light with the skin on application" and hyaluronic acid to "smooth the skin immediately". it also has madecassocide and neurosensine. this side panel says to use morning and night (the drug side of the box says to use it before going into the sun).

it's fragrance is light. the applicator is pointed with a tiny hole to allow minute amounts to be squeezed out of the tube at a time. i applied it thinly. it went on smoothly almost like gliding. i found it not thick or suffocating feeling on the skin.

as to the spf for daily wear i need something higher than 25 as i live in bright sunny houston and get sunburned with less than spf 46 on while driving my car and dashing from the car to stores. i am skeptical about all the claims made for this but remain open minded. since the spf is lower than i need and the price is high i rate this 4 stars = i like it. i use eltamd spf 46 clear every morning and i use a beige face powder with spf 50 for touch ups during the day to prevent sunburn.",2015-10-21,4,4,A3SMR4HRFJARSC,B0038COKQ2
3633,"i ordered this cream for both myself and my wife to use. we have not tried or even heard of this brand before. honestly, these higher-end skin care creams seem almost indistinguishable from each other. french or similar european origin, dermatologists endorsement, slick marketing, pharma-esque packaging, premium pricing, and on. there is nothing wrong with this i suppose, and competition is good for us consumers.

our initial impression is good. the combination of a broad spectrum spf25 sunscreen with a vitamin c/hyaluronic acid moisturizing cream makes this product stand out a bit. it seems appealing as a good all-around daily use product and since it covers a few different bases one could almost consider it somewhat of a value in that sense.

the cream is rather light and rubs in easily. i can definitely feel it's moisturizing effect. it has a barely perceptible scent to it which is not at all offensive. i have rather sensitive skin and have not as of yet had any adverse reactions. we will continue using and expand on our impressions.

i like that the tube arrives completely and unmistakably sealed. in order to open it you must first tighten the cap all the way, which seals the nozzle onto the tube and punctures it.",2015-10-20,4,5,A3M16JSEXT9IKR,B0038COKQ2

3642,"my daughter and wife have been using this sultra bombshell 1-inch and they are impressed with it.  reasons given are "easy to use", "curls fast and they last", and "no frizz".

obviously the thing that jumps out about the sultra is the high price (currently $130 but i've seen <$100).  it's true you can get curling irons for ~$20 but like cars you can get a $20k car or a $100k one...they both roll though one may get you there faster and in more style.  once you add features the price can climb...and in this case the bombshell is ceramic and has infrared heating which are two pricey options above the base model.

infrared heating has become popular in curling irons (or rods) because it heats fast and within which means deeper heating for your hair (faster and longer results).  in terms of use my daughter watched a youtube video about how to use this and she was on her way.  first off so you don't forget this is not a toy it comes with a heating glove and heat resistant pad to rest the rod down.  the glove is great since no more burns (really you could buy a glove to use with any heating iron).  my daughter simply wraps her hair around the rod and instant loose curls and she is very happy with the results.  also note this curling iron does not have a clamp which helps reduce crimping and frizzing.  note that i believe bomba also sells 1.5" version for bigger curls.

build quality is nice and has held up well so far (i will update my review if any issues).  overall, a nice high end curling iron that produces high end results and faster than usual.  you pay more but if the results work for you then compare that to the cost of just a few salon visits.  also note that although pricey this bombshell did make some recent best of lists such as allure.  there are some other curling irons out there with ceramic and infrared that can be purchased for less but i can't speak for their results.  this bombshell gets 4-star rating by us in consideration of price/value.",2018-03-18,4,4,A2V2URLB31HG59,B003YC8NS2

3644,"i am not very good at styling my hair, never used a rod curling iron, and found this one very easy to use.  the glove (which i had also never used) made it easy to wrap my hair and hold it in place without worrying about burning myself.  i  have very thick, coarse hair that is hard to curl and my curls held it all day with no hairspray.  i was expecting to have to flat iron it after my first attempt but to my surprise it looked good and with just a little more practice would look even better.  i expected the rod curling iron to be tapered like most others i have seen, but it is all the same width, so it looks just like a traditional curling iron but without the clip.

the only reason i took off one star is because i do not see the benefits of using a rod curling iron over the old fashioned type of curling iron that clips the end of your hair.  the two minor issues i had would have been solved with a regular curling iron--it was hard to get the curl all the way down to the ends of my hair, and my arms got tired having to do my whole head.  with a regular curling iron i only have to hold the rod with one hand and can switch off but this style of curling iron requires the use of both hands the whole time.",2018-03-11,4,4,AD1ZOPB0BBEHB,B003YC8NS2

3650,"my hair is extremely long, very fine, and (sadly) starting to thin.  its been hard to deal with for as long as i can remember, and even though ive been living with it my entire life, i never quite became good with hair, the way some people do.  on its own its neither perfectly straight nor wavy; it tends to frizz and it attracts static like nobodys business. for the longest time, i wore my hair in the same layered style, turning the ends under and trying to feather the front.  or trying to wear a side part that didn't end up looking greasy by the end of the day.  forget flatirons  they make my hair look limp and in need of a good wash. and in spite of practicing at it every day for a solid year, watching every tutorial out there, and getting an in-person demo from my stylist, i never learned to make spiral curls with one.

the advent of the curling wand was a game changer for me.  i don't have to worry about my wrist not wanting to move a certain way, and i didn't have to learn any special techniques.  its just wrap, count, and release. i can vary the waves by changing the size of the section of hair, and i can loosen them just a touch with a slight tug while they're still warm.  the versatility of these appliances is amazing.  i love that they come in so many sizes and shapes a allow for so many looks.

the sultra bombshell is my fourth curling wand.  the 1  inch straight barrel allows me to do a big, subtle wave thats smooth and sleek.  i love the morticia addams look i can create with this  the waves are so loose, my hair looks like it just has an easy, natural wave.  my hair is extremely long, so a barrel this size works fairly well.  im not sure how it would do on shorter hair.

the wand only has one heat setting, but it heats quickly.  i have another high end wand that gets much, much hotter (which is kind of scary actually) so if you have very thick or very coarse hair, you might want to experiment a bit to get your section size and time right.

i would definitely recommend this wand for anyone who has really long, fine hair like mine.  at the amazon price of $130.00, its actually more expensive than the nume wand i have, but if it lasts as long as that one has (ive had it four years) it would be worth it.

i do have to note that i don't use the heat gloves.  i discovered very early on that they get in my way and cause my very fine hair to frizz.  i am extremely careful when handing these hot wands however, and i don't recommend that anyone go without the glove who hasn't before, unless you are using a wand that has a cool tip (most higher end wands do not have one, but both of my remington wands have this feature).  it takes a lot of practice to handle these things safely so its better to practice with a glove or a cool tip beforehand.",2018-02-18,5,5,A3U0S17XYK8XMJ,B003YC8NS2

i don't mind paying more for a tool that does something amazing for me. in this case, this iron gives me soft, shiny curls that last all day. but, so does my revlon wand at a significantly lower price. the thing that sets this curling wand apart--and above--for me is the time. i don't know if it's because of the way this wand retains heat throughout the barrel or what but i can curl my entire head in about 1/3 the time it normally takes me. that's huge in my opinion.",2018-02-16,1,3,AFEYHFH2GH0QZ,B003YC8NS2

3654,"with a 1 1/2" barrel, you will get nice waves. if you want more defined curls, you would need to get a smaller barrel. this works great on my hair, which is fairly long and fine, i would have liked to be able to reduce the heat, since my hair is thin but i didn't seem to have any breakage while i was using it to test it out. for me, i would benefit from having my daughter come over to use this on the back of my hair - which is where i have an issue doing it myself. somehow, i do manage to get it done with my head upside down and then i got back to the very top for some volume. i like that this comes with a swivel cord, a large barrel, easy on off switch and a glove for holding your hair against the barrel. as i play with it more, i think i will get better with it and may have to do a blow out before i do the waves. it is simple easy to use. and you get instructions to guide you along. you will also need clips to section your hair, since the smallest amounts will work best for a defined curl or wave.",2018-02-09,4,5,A25QBCHO0KFT0P,B003YC8NS2
3655,"i have looked all over for the glove and can't find it. i checked inside the packaging twice. is there a secret compartment on the handle that holds the glove that i can't find? meanwhile, i don't see why they could not have put a few spikes on this to hold the hair in place rather than make you wear a glove and then change the glove hand to do the other side of your head. that's a lot of work. but i can see this is how all the female commentators on fox news end up with those spirals of hair on their shoulders. i am concerned that none of the other reviews say theirs came without a glove.

this is very expensive for what it does. couldn't you just twist a regular curling iron around the ends of your hair?

meanwhile, if it touches your face -- and that's not hard to do when you are trying to twist the hair on the side of your head around it -- you burn your face. a few spikes would have served as a buffer between your skin and the hot rod.",2018-02-09,2,5,A1ZKGSDVP057L9,B003YC8NS2
3656,"the sultra bombshell rod allows for nice, big curls (spiral or not, it depends on how you wrap your hair around it). yes, this is one of those wand curling rods where it takes a little getting used to things, and they provide a pink heat resistant glove so you can hold the end of the hair close to the heated ceramic barrel - half the time i don't use it. though i advice you wear it if you're new to this type of curling iron.

what i like about this? the ceramic barrel. the 'turning' cord which lets you move the iron around, the auto turn-off and a pad on which you can set the iron down when it's hot.

what i don't like? i do wish it had a lower setting, even just a 'low/high' setting. i know it's supposed to be an optimal setting and it's a little lower than some of the ones on other curling irons and high settings on flat irons, but a little choice would be nice.

that said, it did produce some very nice curls without too much effort, following the instructions (wrap, hold for a few seconds, release, hold again, move on to another section). my hair did look nice and shiny, but i also don't do curls very often, just for special occasions. the size of the iron, with the nice big handle, made it easy to hold, too. all in all, it's rather nice, though it is on the higher end, price-wise.",2018-02-09,4,3,A3EAP2VG0BVYWX,B003YC8NS2

3667,"my sultra iron and i have been on a long journey together. we recently had our 5th anniversary together. that right there shows you the quality of the build of this iron-that this unit is built to last. the black ceramic of the iron is durable and easy to clean, so no matter how much hairspray gets all over it, it's easy to get off with a clean washcloth (when it's unplugged and cold of course!)

mine came with a pink glove which was lost eons ago as i stopped using it. i found that it caused my hair to be more frizzy and harder to curl in the long run than being a bit more deliberate and delicate while handling the iron. i typically use the "point the iron down with your opposite hand" method and just have the teeny tiny end of my hair that ends up uncurled. this is kind of good anyway since the type of curl you want with this iron is more of a beach you wave instead of a structured curl.

depending on how you hold the hair on the iron *and for how long* will decide how the curls look. wrapping like a flat ribbon of hair gives more of a traditional curl look, while wrapping the strand of hair in a spiral and then twirling around the wand will give more of a spirally mermaid look. the best part about this iron is that it will curl almost any type of hair, even the most pin-straight. even my asian girlfriends approve and bought their own.

i got this as a gift back in 2010 before there were 200 curling wands on the market and before the tapered wands seemed to be the size and style of choice-but the extra money for this model is so worth it. i've used my sister's tapered model and it doesn't look the same. hair doesn't naturally get more curly at the bottom so that seems odd to me-plus the curl didn't hold, with this model i literally have curls until my next wash 2 days later.

now that there are multiple sizes of this iron it's harder to choose-1 inch is a great one size fits all model. 3/4 is great for tighter curls and shorter hair, and the 1.5 is better for really long haired gals who want beach waves and those girls who have easy to curl hair and only want a loose wave. keep in mind all curls drop so don't get this one if you have medium length hair, it won't make a lot of difference. but this is the curler for those girls who thought they were destined to be straight haired their entire life-it is a miracle worker!!",2016-06-05,5,4,A1F1SGYXCMVHF4,B003YC8NS2

- there has been some lightening of stretch marks. they didn't magically disappear, but they are lighter. i always placed this under lotion.
- i can see where my wrinkles are going to be, usually at the end of a hot day where i was sweating. i started applying this to those areas (still applying moisturizer) and it helped smooth out those fine lines that "temporarily" appear when my skin is too dry.

it's not a easy solve product, but i think we're getting closer and closer to seeing products with real advantages with topical application.",2014-08-23,4,5,A2VQVI5X3VTDT3,B004IZA3YG
3678,"i've been using this strivectin sd for about one month now.  i wish i could say at this point i look 10 years younger but none of these types of creams have done that for me or magically turned me into george clooney.  but, this strivectin sd does feel good when i wear it on my face - goes on smooth, it feels light and comfortable, it doesn't make my face greasy, and i have no strange skin reactions thus far.  my skin hasn't shown any miraculous improvements but in fairness i've been using these types of products for years (various brands) and my skin has improved over that time and i like to think i look good for my 40-ish age (plus my mom tells me so thus it must be true).

but in my opinion the most important thing a person can do to preserve a youthful look is to protect your facial skin from the damaging rays from the sun...and this strivectin sd has no spf in it.  so, i don't wear it during the day - only at night.  this is almost a deal killer for me - these days when i buy nice face creams i look for versions with spf.

so in conclusion - i've been using this cream at night and its been fine for me, no spf is a big negative for me, $139 price is too high for me relative to some other nice skin creams i purchase and use.  so overall 3 star rating from me in consideration of price/value.",2014-08-08,3,3,A2V2URLB31HG59,B004IZA3YG

this product does work. it reduces wrinkles and stretch marks gradually. i felt that massaging the cream onto my skin really made a difference. it took about two weeks before i noticed any changes, but they were there.

this product is pricey and probably varies in effectiveness depending on skin tone. but the question you're probably asking yourself right now is whether or not this works. the simple answer is yes. it's excellent at getting undesirable marks to fade. i was very pleased with the results.",2014-08-06,5,5,A3J029KBNG5MNP,B004IZA3YG

3681,"the strivectin intensive concentrate claims that results will show in about a week and it actually seems like it has reduced the appearance of my winkles and stretch marks. i have very little wrinkles and stretch marks, but i can still notice my stretch marks if i look really close. this cream make it even less noticeable, but it was not very noticeable to begin with.

i use it twice a day, in the morning and at night, but it feels heavy under my makeup. sometimes i forgo my moisturizer and just use this and a primer underneath my makeup because my makeup still ha spf. it's fine at night since i use this and a moisturizer and even if it still feels a bit heavy, i don't mind since i'm sleeping anyways.

i'm a bit concerned about the ingredient list on this product because i always check the ingredient list on my makeup, face and body products. i avoid products that use parabens for sure and i look up every ingredient to judge the toxicity of the ingredient. some of the ingredients here seem questionable, but i think it all depends on your perception of what is toxic. for example, a lot of makeup products contain paraben and mica, especially some powder foundations, and although the amount used is a small amount, i don't want to take any risk, so i choose to purchase products that have a less toxic ingredient list. there are a lot of hair products out and a lot of the popular name-brand products boast no sulfates, no parabens, and no phthalates. so it is completely up to you if you believe that the ingredients used in a product is actually a significant amount enough to actually be toxic.

so even though this products appear to work, i don't think i would purchase again. it is expensive for 4.5 fl oz and i don't feel comfortable with the ingredient list, so i will search for other products to combat wrinkles and stretch marks. if i can't find one, i can deal with wrinkles and stretch marks and try to prevent it with a good skin care routine.",2014-08-04,4,3,A2FLJCJ3SW0TUY,B004IZA3YG

3683,"i've been going full blazes with high end anti-aging and wrinkle creams this year. i've used various strivectin products before, namely the advanced wrinkle reducer. it was ok - not the best and not the worst, but definitely something i wouldn't pay a ton of money for. the strivectin sd is different than the previous wrinkle reducer. this one specifically names stretch marks as one of its targets, leading me rightly to believe it is stronger than products made specifically for the face.

good thing my skin is tough, so to speak. i don't easily break out or react badly to products that might bring on a rash or worse in someone with more sensitive skin. i tried the sd concentrate on my neck for those ring-like lines you get when you hit your 30s (my mother used to say it was like counting the rings on a tree trunk to tell its age!)

i was pleasantly surprised. the sd concentrate did make a difference. the lines, after several weeks of use, are definitely less noticeable. but having said that, i'd also warn the sensitive of skin to be careful with this product. i didn't use it on my face (i'm full to the gills with anti-aging and wrinkle creams and serums!), but i did notice a slight flush on my neck where i used the strivectin. the color disappeared after several days, but it was noticeable. i'd fear what this cream would do to the facial complexion, it is that strong.

if you have deep furrows, or any other part of your body beside your face is showing its age, this cream should be one you consider for real results. just beware that it is strong and may be a bit more than your face can handle.",2014-08-03,4,5,A2JCJJNY43QQIV,B004IZA3YG

what i can say so far is that i have had no adverse effects on my skin from this product. my skin tends to be more sensitive than most, so i was careful when i first started using it. i started by putting it only on one side of my face to see what would happen. there was definitely a slight burning/tingling sensation where i had put the cream, but no redness or itching. the next day i felt safe enough to use it all over my face, except near my eyes, which they warn against doing. i've been using it regularly ever since, with no problems. i still get the slight burning feeling after applying it, but no bad reactions, so i don't worry about it. the smell is pleasant, sort of minty, and i like the way it makes my skin feel after applying.",2014-07-30,4,4,A14EPTYN50XSZV,B004IZA3YG

application directions are for twice each day...morning and evening.

i do not have many lines or wrinkles as i have tried to care for my skin and protect it from the sun for the most part.  i do use different products that afford enhancement and protection to my complexion.  i do not have any stretch marks so i cannot attest to that factor.

after approximately two weeks i noticed one area to be definitively smoother and another area that seemed better a week or two later.  with the application of makeup those areas looked even smoother.

i continued to scrutinize and was wondering whether i wanted to believe the results as opposed to...did the strivectin do anything?

after using the product for about four weeks now, i noticed some photos taken at family events and yes there was a difference!

i have been applying it twice daily on those areas on my face, neck and d&eacute;colletage.

note this product has no sunscreen.  ensure that you get that protection for daytime use.

also, make certain that you wash your hands after application of the strivectin before applying any other product to your skin to avoid irritation.

for now...five stars!",2014-07-23,5,5,A914TQVHI872U,B004IZA3YG

all that being said, i can only attest to the moisturizing, skin softening and skin plumping that comes from applying this after washing. wrinkles and creases between my eyebrows are softened and diminished, as are the age rings on my neck. i do expect to see additional benefits with continued use.",2014-07-21,4,5,A2MUGFV2TDQ47K,B004IZA3YG
3694,"i've always been skeptical of the price ranges that strivectin products come in. i was interested in trying out this cream to see if it really was worth the price tag and the hype.

week one was really quite pathetic. i normally use a glycolic cream at night, eye cream and a moisturizer with sun protection. discontinued all of those to use only a clinique face wash and this cream morning and night. i saw no impact on wrinkles or stretch marks but i did see an increase in oiliness around the t zone. also had some mild breakout on the forehead but figured that could be the summer heat as well.

week two saw the oiliness gone and the bumps as well. i started to notice some improvement in an even skin tone.

at the beginning of week three i can really see that the cream works - at least with my skin. the tone is better, the wrinkles are not as deep and it does an excellent job hydrating the skin and keeping it supple.

so, is it worth the price tag? for me, it could be since it replaces three other creams that add up to well over the price for this much larger tube. i do wish it came with a little spf in it but i suppose no cream is perfect.

the very long ingredient list is an interesting mixed bag of natural extracts and some chemicals. on the one hand it has shea butter, aloe, ginger root extract, green bean seed extract and resveratrol.  on the other hand it also has bht and the beautifully vaguely defined 'parfum'. if you are steering clear of any chemicals in particular you may want to have a good look at the ingredient list. nothing jumped out on my radar as unsafe but all of us have different standards.

on the whole, it is a product that seems worth the investment and i plan on replacing my previous products with this one.

update: week 3 and 4 saw a continued improvement to skin texture. old scars are shallower and dark spots are lighter too! i would recommend applying this to the neck as well since it improves firmness very quickly. i am so thrilled to have tried this product!",2014-07-21,5,5,A3TWBW1B17R151,B004IZA3YG
3695,"i've wanted to use strivectin for a long time after seeing it in costco and ads in magazines. i normally use a daily regimen and moisturizing from mary kay, and have also used moisturizers from l'oreal skin genesis, jouer (tinted moisturizer which i love), burt's bees, gio pelle "hydrosilk" and a couple more.

it's only been two weeks, so i would like to update this at a later date, but here's what i have noticed so far:

1. it goes on thinly, so i only use a small drop to cover most of my face.
2. the direction say to avoid the eye area, and that's where most of my wrinkles/problem areas are, so i did apply under the eye with no adverse reaction.
3. it's a bit greasy feeling and leaves a shine on my face--which is ok as i have dryish combination skin. for someone with oily or real combination skin, the sheen may be a problem until it soaks in (if it does for you).
4. the scent is pleasant, not too strong but not 100% odorless.
5. 4.5 ounces is actually a good size bottle and i have barely put a dent in the contents.

as for the wrinkles, i honestly think it's too short a time span to notice a big change. i like the moisturizing effect, esp. under foundation, but i do not see an impact on wrinkles. i have not tried this product on stretch marks.",2014-07-21,4,5,A2GP6XJ1V3MM3L,B004IZA3YG

this does not absorb into the skin. applied (sparingly!) in the morning, the areas i used it on remained tacky and sticky the entire day.  i couldn't wear a necklace for fear of ruining it.  still, i continued to use it twice/day, hoping something amazing would happen.

i have normal skin, and i have kept good care of it. a few wrinkles and lines no doubt, but i am also of retirement age, and people often tell me i look much younger. i use an expensive day moisturizer, and i am always looking for a moisturizer that will keep my skin in its great condition. i am pretty sure i have found it with this day moisturizer. a light cream that i apply daily right after i have cleansed my skin. my skin retains its moisture, and my skin is very smooth. very happy with this moisturizer, a nice light scent, a moisturizer that is equal to the expensive moisturizer i use. mature skin with a good foundation is open to this moisturizer. young women would do well to start with this ahava brand of moisturizer.

after reading some of the reviews, i feel the need to point out this is a facial moisturizer. of course you can use it on your hands, but why would you when it's formulated in a lighter, more absorbent texture for your face? a little goes a long way, and this small tube will last much longer if you use it where it's meant to go!

i'd also point out what a deal the mini is of this. not only can you get a lot more by buying multiple minis than you can by buying the jar, but because you are only using these as you need them, they stay sanitary and sealed. just a tip for you bargain hunters (me!) out there who like premium skincare at the best price. :)",2015-08-05,5,5,A2JCJJNY43QQIV,B004TMRW24

these product vial containers are so small. the containors, really need a revision, and i don't like needing to mix three different products. the dropper feels cheap, like my childs early chemistry play set. maybe nuface could create a simple pump dispenser with three chambers that could insert these serums into a single pump.",2016-07-02,4,4,A8QYRG7TW491B,B005CX2DTQ

easy to apply, bottles are marked as s1, s2, and s3. on a clean face, first apply 4-5 drops of nourisher (s1), then 4-5 drops of smoother (s2), and at last 4-5 drops of lifter (s3). all bottles comes with dropper style caps, so it's very easy to get the desired amount of serums. although these are sample size bottles but will last longer, as each application requires only a tiny amount of the product.

3781,"i tried these anti-aging serums out for over two weeks and i love trying out new skincare products to assist in wrinkle smoothing and to help my skin feel healthy and moisturized and protected.  there are three tiny bottles including a nourisher: which has "superfruit stem cell serum" per the product description; the smoother: "a powerhouse peptide complex;" and finally a lifter: which is predominantly comprised of vitamin c and hyaluronic acid, the droppers are easy to use and the bottles look cute on my counter but overall i felt that the three step process was a bit much when the results didn't really make a visible difference and there is no sunscreen to help protect from further skin damage. while it made my skin feel moisturized it definitely slowed me down as applying three products is time consuming and part of me wondered why they didn't just make one huge bottle with all three serums mixed since you're layering them on one after another anyway. also, olay products are much cheaper than the cost per ounce of this brand and many have needed sunscreen protection.",2016-06-25,3,3,A16WPA6JV83YXT,B005CX2DTQ

i am dropping one star only because i wish this sampler was included with each nuface machine purchase - i am quite sure people would want more serums.

nuface and similar products have been used on hollywood sets for years, to enhance on-camera appearance.  trust me. men and women. been there, done it!

the serums are easy to use, and tend to enhance the lifting properties that you get instantly  with a nuface unit, and in a cumulative fashion, when used over weeks and months.",2016-06-16,4,5,A3VBZDYGHF4NK8,B005CX2DTQ
3784,"these are serums, which means they are thick and intended for intensive treatment, usually overnight. because of this, they are too heavy and greasy for regular use during the day. there is nothing wrong with that, and in fact, that's what i was looking for, but it is important to know that you won't want to wear this to work.

the advertising hype on the package is even more amped up than others of its kind. stem cells? really? i read further. oh, stem cells from plants, that's a relief. wait. plants have stem cells?

it is a moisturizer, folks. not a miracle drug for your face. i also had a heck of a time trying to figure out why there were three of them, and specifically what the difference between them was. the first one says to keep it away from your eyes, for example, so this matters. i got the impression they are supposed to be used in order too, so i lined mine up.

the tiny light-gray, low-contrast lettering didn't make this easy. i tried a bright light first, then ended up reading it with a flashlight. my backup plan was to take a picture of it with my phone and enlarge it enough to read it. why in the world do manufacturers do this? and in a product marketed toward, ahem, not twenty year olds. minus one star for making instructions nobody can read.

the other problem is the cost, though on amazon that tends to vary, even within the same day, so i don't know how much this will be selling for on the day you happen to see it. i will say that the suggested price seems insanely overpriced, especially for such tiny little bottles. but, you know that going in, so the choice is yours.

3785,"recently i started applying oils to mu skin.  i started off with the face and i am not expanding on moisturizing neck and chest area.  i really like this trio.  it comes in a small attractive packaging and it has three options: nourishing oil, smoothing oil and lifting oil.  i am applying lifting oil to my neck, nourishing oil around the eyes and lips are and smoothing oil to the rest of my face.  i recently purchased on amazon sonic facial cleanser.  so my skin routine for the extended weekend ritual included cleansing the skin with sonic cleanser, toning it with facial toner, and then applying oils for extended moisturizing effect.  i like to leave this oil overnight on my skin and i have noticed that my skin is visibly softer to the touch and yet firm.

really nice product that can be applied to any skin type.  the other nice thing about the product is that it is non-greasy.  it absorbs quickly so if you sleep with it, it will not mess up your pillow cases.  although bottles may look too small, only a small amount of product is needed for application.  i believe that this product will enhance anyone's skin, regardless of the age.  also it is suitable for both men and women.",2016-06-15,5,5,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B005CX2DTQ

3788,"these three serums are designed to work together to improve the appearance of your skin. now, to be fair, my wrinkles are approaching grand canyon proportions and nothing is going to make them go away, but these non-greasy drops absorb quickly, take seconds to apply, and make my aging skin feel softer and smoother, the directions say to apply four drops of each elixir in order, and i wondered how i was going to do that until i saw that each bottle contains a perfectly-sized medicine dropper. perfect!",2016-06-12,5,5,ABEAUXVVB2E1M,B005CX2DTQ
3789,"i've been using a nuface mini device now for seven months and really like it, so i was happy to be able to be able to try out their serums.  for years, i've been using paula's choice products (a vitamin c serum and an antioxidant serum), and i think that i like these nuface products just as much, although using all three is a bit of a pain and the price is too high for such small bottles.

with this set, you apply all three products in a specific order, finishing off with the lifter serum.  the instructions call for using 5-6 drops of each, but i've found that i can use less and still get good coverage on my face and neck.

since there isn't much information that comes in the package or here on the amazon website, i did a bit of research about each formula and its ingredients:

*  nourisher (step 1) -- contains alpine rose, apple, and grape stem cells; this is supposed to help with sun damage, hyperpigmentation, or dehydrated skin

*  ingredients in nourisher:  water, glycerin, malus domestica fruit cell culture (apple stem cell), xanthan gum, lecithin, algae extract, artemisia vulgaris extract, vitis vinifera fruit cell extract (grape stem cells), isomalt, sodium benzoate, rhododendron ferrugineum leaf cell culture extract (alpine rose stem cells), lactic acid, phenoxyethanol , caprylyl glycol, ethylhexylglycerin, hexylene glycol, allantoin, disodium edta, pichia/resveratrol ferment extract.

*  smoother (step 2) -- this one contains peptides, which are proven wrinkle-smoothers

*  ingredients in smoother:  water, glycerin, polyglyceryl methacrylate, palmitoyl oligopeptide, butylene glycol, carbomer, polysorbate 20, palmitoyl pentapeptide-4 (matrixyl), acetyl hexapeptide-8 (argireline), hydrolyzed rice bran protein , glycine soja (soybean) protein , oxido reductases (regu-age), hesperidin methyl chalcone , steareth-20, dipeptide-2, palmitoyl tetrapeptide-7 (eyeliss), algae extract, artemisia vulgaris extract, dipeptide diaminobutyroyl benzylamide diacetate (syn-ake), xanthan gum, phenoxyethanol, caprylyl glycol , ethylhexylglycerin, hexylene glycol, allantoin, disodium edta, pichia/resveratrol ferment extract.

*  lifter vitamin c & hyaluronic acid serum -- this one stings a bit on my sensitive skin when i first apply it, but doesn't cause any redness or irritation; it contains ascorbic acid (vitamin c) 14%, sodium hyaluronic 5%, and glycolic acid 1%; these ingredients are supposed to help with skin tone and reduce the appearance of wrinkles, acne scarring, and hyperpigmentation

*  ingredients in lifter:  water, ascorbic acid, glycerin, butylene glycol, sodium hyaluronate, sorbitol, peg-8/ smdi copolymer, camellia sinensis (green tea) leaf extract, dimethicone, hydrolyzed glycosaminoglycans, glycolic acid, polysorbate 20, phenoxyethanol, caprylyl glycol, ethylhexylglycerin, hexylene glycol, zinc sulfate, sodium hydroxide, xanthan gum, pyridoxine dipalmitate, disodium edta, ergothioneine, allantoin.

cons:

*  these should come in opaque bottles to keep the potency of the serums intact longer.

*  the price is really high for all three, especially since it has such small bottles.  i use much less than the bottles call for, but they still will only last a few months.

while i've seen smoother skin since i've started using these, i think i had comparable results with my paula's choice products, and will most likely go back to using those once i finish using the set since i can mix them together for quicker application and since the price works out to be a lot less. i've read individual product review on other websites, and the smoother serum seems to be really well-liked, so i may just get that one and not all three.

i wrote a review of the nuface mini a few weeks ago (which i bought here on amazon), and really do like that device, and, while the serums re nice, a better price point would make them more attractive.",2016-06-10,3,4,A2V5R832QCSOMX,B005CX2DTQ
3790,"this has been a part of my beauty routine for a while now so i feel pretty confident reviewing these. i will say the biggest compliment i get is how soft my skin is and how refined my pores look. really smoothes out the texture of your skin. i have two dark marks they have made them about 90 percent less noticeable and easily covered with less makeup now.  nourisher is a few drops rub into skin and make sure to get your entire face ( except the eye area)  the smoother is used on signs of aging and lines.  the lifter i use at night before bed.  really nice system no skin irritation for me.  and it works very well.",2016-06-09,5,5,A2XH6KI5ZLRLPS,B005CX2DTQ
3791,"these nuface anti-aging infusion serums promise to nourish, smooth and lift the skin.  i was dubious when i notice the first two ingredients being water and glycerin.  i found them to be very sticky and left my face with a muggy feel.

the nourisher which contains plant based extract of stem cells should be used 2x per day.  the smoother contains eyeliss, which is hesperidin and can reduce puffiness around the eyes; this is to be used 2x per day.  the lifter seems to be vitamin c and hyaluronic acid which is a fluid found in the eyes and connective tissue. the lifter should be used 1x per day.

i found nothing in the ingredient list or after i used these serums to justify the price point.  im sure they won't harm you but there are many products on the market that offer similar results are a more attractive price.",2016-06-09,3,3,ATECU14VUIOJ0,B005CX2DTQ

3793,"as a retired skin care professional i'm very picky about the quality of the products i use to say the least (!). i am very happy with the results of these serums and i feel that they do as they promise. facial serum can have a variety of viscosities from thick to thin, these serums are on the thinner side in texture. that doesn't impact the effectiveness but some care must be taken in application to avoid wasting product. this set is ideal for test driving the serums and finding the one(s) you like best. i like the lifting & smoothing serums the best myself.

one of the lovely things about using serums is that they can be used around the eyes as long as there are no irritating ingredients. these serums caused no eye irritation for me whatsoever. fine lines and wrinkles are less noticeable with a definite softening in texture of the skin. my own skin has taken on a subtle, yet perceivable glow. i'm using these serums under my moisturizer however i still feel a difference using them alone. all serums can feel a bit sticky due to the concentration of ingredients and that problem can be alleviated with using some moisturizer on top.

my makeup application looks smoother and more refined except for one foundation that i wear that is my long wearing "bulletproof" brand. it causes the product to pill somewhat but it does that with pretty much any serum so that's no surprise. these serums play well with lighter foundations, in my case a tinted moisturizer or cc cream. i have exceptionally dry skin due to a health condition so i feel that's the main troublemaker with me and the products i use. note that effectiveness can be greatly impacted by skin that needs exfoliation. if you have trouble with absorption, you most likely need to get rid of excess dead skin so that the product can get through and do it's work.

i feel that these serums are the ideal companions for users of the nuface devices. while the containers are small, not much is needed for application. there are no fragrances to struggle with here, either. they are gentle (non irritating) yet effective. if you're not quite sure what to do with serums there's plenty of info online to guide you for your skin type. i'm impressed with the results so far and highly recommend them.",2016-06-07,5,5,A2GA64WZK8PKBC,B005CX2DTQ
3794,"the 3 x .25 oz. sampler works very well with nuface's microcurrent devices. i know this because my wife has been using one for the past almost one year and she continues to be very pleased with it.

if you are going to use them 'as directed' you will be making quite a commitment because you are expected to apply the nourisher and the smoother twice daily and the lifter once a day. i have to admit that ms. cthulhu is only using them before the microcurrent treatment and she's only doing it twice a week because she's in 'maintenance mode' at this time. and she's very happy with the results. her skin is above-average sensitive but, so far, she is tolerating these quite well.

i am not a specialist and there are lots of ingredients in each of the three samples but the makers claim that the nourisher contains apple, grape and alpine rose stem cell extracts, the smoother has a long list of multi-syllable and difficult to pronounce ingredients and the lifter features vitamin c and hyaluronic acid.

to conclude, these are good skin treatments. they seem to enhance the effects of the microcurrent nuface devices, don't know if they should be tried without it. also, 'for best results', the makers recommend that you use them together. like most skin potions, the don't work the same of different persons so, given the price, trying the sampler before making a more substantial commitment is probably the right thing to do.",2016-06-07,4,4,ADLVFFE4VBT8,B005CX2DTQ

3796,"per the wife: i have the nuface microcurrent device (both full size and mini). these products are incredible in toning your skin and have gotten rid of my jowls. i am 53 (soon to be 54) and have not had botox or surgery. i am always trying new facial devices and serums (and masks, etc.) looking for the best that is out there.  i get a facial every 6 weeks. i have been very impressed with the nuface products. these serums are travel/sampler size, not the full product, and if you are expecting a full sized product, you will be very disappointed. each is .25, whereas individually, these run around $85 for 1 oz.  these can be used individually or layers.  if you own a light therapy or microcurrent device (i own both) these are used to optimize your treatment. these go on easily and are quickly absorbed into the skin.
the nourisher superfruit stem cell serum (promotes cell renewal) goes on first after washing and toning. it is an anti-inflammatory. you apply 4-5 drops on face and neck.  the ingredients are: water (aqua), glycerin, malus domestica fruit cell culture (apple stem cell), xanthan gum, lecithin, algae extract, artemisia vulgaris extract, vitis vinifera fruit cell extract (grape stem cells), isomalt, sodium benzoate, rhododendron ferrugineum leaf cell culture extract (alpine rose stem cells), lactic acid, phenoxyethanol , caprylyl glycol, ethylhexylglycerin, hexylene glycol, allantoin, disodium edta, pichia/resveratrol ferment extract.  you will note that it says "s1" on the bottle - this tells you that it is the first to be applied.
the second serum is the smoother infusion serum (1 fl oz) - smooth fine lines & wrinkles with 6 powerful anti-aging peptides.  peptides are the key to relaxing wrinkles and fine lines. this serum says "s2" on the bottle, so you know that it is applied second (following the superfruit). again, apply 4-5 drops to the face and neck.  the ingredients are: water (aqua), glycerin, polyglyceryl methacrylate, palmitoyl oligopeptide, butylene glycol, carbomer, polysorbate 20, palmitoyl pentapeptide-4 (matrixyl), acetyl hexapeptide-8 (argireline), hydrolyzed rice bran protein , glycine soja (soybean) protein , oxido reductases (regu-age), hesperidin methyl chalcone , steareth-20, dipeptide-2, palmitoyl tetrapeptide-7 (eyeliss), algae extract, artemisia vulgaris extract, dipeptide diaminobutyroyl benzylamide diacetate (syn-ake), xanthan gum, phenoxyethanol, caprylyl glycol , ethylhexylglycerin, hexylene glycol, allantoin, disodium edta, pichia/resveratrol ferment extract.  note - no parabens or other harmful ingredients. it delivers instant wrinkle reduction results.
the third serum is the lifter (life and hydration).  it says "s3" - so you know that it is applied third following serums 1 and 2. lifter serum ingredients are:twater (aqua), ascorbic acid, glycerin, butylene glycol, sodium hyaluronate, sorbitol, peg-8/ smdi copolymer, camellia sinensis (green tea) leaf extract, dimethicone, hydrolyzed glycosaminoglycans, glycolic acid, polysorbate 20, phenoxyethanol, caprylyl glycol, ethylhexylglycerin, hexylene glycol, zinc sulfate, sodium hydroxide, xanthan gum, pyridoxine dipalmitate, disodium edta, ergothioneine, allantoin.
these can be used individually or layered.
if you are using these with your microcurrent device, cleanse the skin with an oil-free cleanser, then - optional: apply preferred nuface serum (so one of these three) by tapping into your skin with your fingertips. then apply nuface gel primer in a mask-like layer to one area at a time, beginning with the left cheek. after using the device, you can finish by apply serum of your choice and follow your regular skincare routine.
i really love these serums. they are high quality ingredients and work great with the nuface microcurrent device or alone as part of a regular skincare regime.

3797,"this set contains three small (.25 oz) bottles of serum.  water and glycerin are the top two ingredients in each (with ascorbic acid -- vitamin c --in the third).  the first is a "nourisher" to be used twice a day; the second is a "smoother" to be used twice a day and the third is a "lifter" to be used once a day.  the ingredient list on the package is  in such a tiny font that you can hardly read the print.  the nourisher claims to have some plant based stem cell extracts.  the smoother does contain a substance called "eyeliss" which has been proven to be effective.  the lifter key ingredients seem to be ascorbic acid and hyaluronic acid for hydration.  these are very nice serums; they leave your skin feeling softer and smoother (and just slightly sticky).  i gave this three stars because i don't think they are worth the price.  as facial products go there are better places to invest.  i will say that i am in love with the nuface mini.  there are sometimes places where you can get one for 20% off  and dollar for dollar, this device is a great deal.  it really does work.  but as far as
topical formulations, i think the most effective products are two that are also relatively inexpensive: plain old off-patent tretinoin and a generic vitamin c serum.",2016-06-05,3,3,A15T487HNTIOF7,B005CX2DTQ

although this says it's for all skin types, i noted that another reviewer said it made her break out. since i'm very acne-prone, i decided not to use this on my face, but concentrate on my neck, decolletage, and back of hands.

overall, these serums go on nicely and my skin looks fine, but there was no immediate wow factor. i checked the manufacturer's website, and it seems these are designed to work with their ($325) microcurrent device.  not sure if they do much on their own.",2016-06-03,3,3,A2OW1FKQFPIA5D,B005CX2DTQ

3832,"i've been wearing some dark makeup throughout the winter, but when i pulled mary-lou manizer from my beauty drawer, i knew it was spring--and time to change up my look.

mary-lou manizer, a highlighter, should not be confused with betty-lou manizer, a bronzer.  the adorable package will help you make the right choice.  mary-lou comes in a round mirrored compact with a mug shot, that's right, a mug shot of bad, blonde mary-lou.

my skin is pale, my hair is dark, and my eyes are green.  i love mary-lou manizer for daytime as an all-over eye shadow.  it highlights under my brow and on my eyelid it really makes my lashes stand out.

the honey-colored powder adds a lot of shimmer without looking glittery.  it's very soft and easy to apply.  i do find that it can gather in the creases of my eyelids by the end of the day, but because the color is so light, i really have to look for it.

i find that my eyes look brighter and much less tired when i swipe on mary-lou manizer in the morning.

personally, i wouldn't wear it as a highlighter on the rest of my face unless i was heading to a party or to the beach.  i just don't think it's the right look for me.",2014-05-05,4,4,A2FQZKL2KIZACO,B0065I8MC4

3845,"i'm always on the lookout for new deodorants to try in the quest to find one that smells great and lasts a long time. over the years i've become much more conscious about what i put in/on my body, and i've switched to using only aluminum-free deodorants which are much safer for your body.  the down-side to using non-aluminum products is that they do not keep you from perspiring, which is both good and bad.  good because sweat is your body's way of getting rid of toxins - it's important that you don't keep this from happening.  but the flip side is that nobody wants to be all sweaty and grody under their arms all day.
vichy is an aluminum-free, salt-free and paraben-free deodorant - it does not stop sweat but does work to stop the smell that is caused by the bacteria from the sweat. it does this using only minerals, no chemicals or anything harmful. this particular formula is designed to prevent odor for low to moderate activity during a 24 hour period so basically on days where it's not too warm and you don't plan on doing much activity/exercise.  right now we're in the hottest part of summer here in massachusetts so using one application of this deodorant in the morning is typically not enough to last the entire day- by the time i get home from work even without any strenuous activity or exercise i do notice the slightest hint of body odor in my pitts, so if i have plans to go back out after work for any reason or know i'm going to be around other people i'll apply some more deodorant before i go out.
i'm not a big fan of roll-on deodorants but this one applies pretty well and evenly without any drips or mess and dries quickly without leaving any trace or marks on your clothes.  the smell is a bit hard to describe, i think it definitely leans more towards a feminine/floral scent but not a lot and once it dries you can't really smell it unless you put your nose to your arm-pit.  personally i like the smell, it's nice but not too strong.
overall i do like it this deodorant, i just need to remember to apply more on really warm days or where i know i'm going to be very active and sweating more. keep in mind that if you have been using traditional anti-perspirant deodorants that prevent sweating before you switch to something like this product that does not block sweat, you are going to go through what is called a 'de-tox' period where your body is going to cleanse itself from all the impurities that have built up for the time you were blocking that sweat and using that other product. this detox period could last several days and even up to a few weeks, so don't be discouraged if this doesn't work very well for you at first, give it some time.
vichy is a gold-standard company when it comes to design and production of their products - they are committed to protecting the planet by recycling and reducing consumption of raw materials as much as possible. they also do not test on animals. they have been creating skin-products for 80 years and are focused on combining natural ingredients with modern research.",2017-07-09,4,5,A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E,B006989VBG

3857,"it's summer, so what better time to take a chance on a new deodorant?  the scent on this one is like baby powder multiplied.  i can be pretty sensitive to smells.  strong scents especially perfumes or strong chemicals  are one of the few known triggers for my migraines and this one is bordering on trouble for me.  i didn't actually get a full on migraine but it did make a little nauseous and fearful for about the first hour after i applied it because it stayed really strong that long.

because of the heat i did use it on a low activity day and it was fine for that.  but once i added in  a little exercise (walking and the simply fit board -- so nothing too demanding) i did start to smell hints of sweat mixed with baby powder.

i would only recommend this for people who either already don't sweat much or those who really like the baby powder scent or for really low activity days.  it's just not strong enough for the kinds of days where you really need protection and the protection is does offer is more of a masking of the sweat with an overpowering scent.",2017-06-23,2,3,A2E0TJ49NACDBA,B006989VBG

in regards to the body odor protection, i think the odor of the product is unpleasant on it's own.  it smelled okay sniffing it from the bottle, but once it made contact with my skin it was like the aroma changed for the worse.

3875,"this vichy aluminum free deodorant stick works really well for me. i apply it once in the morning after my shower, and i'm still not stinky at the end of the day or even by the next morning. my activity level tends to be light to moderate, so i can't speak to how well this works for those who engage in strenuous activity. but for me this works great. it seems really gentle as i don't get any irritation or rash, even when applied just a short time after shaving or epilating my underarms. the shape and size of the stick is just right for a comfortable application, and the product consistency is slick (no chalkiness) and glides on smoothly. this stick deodorant doesn't feel wet or sticky and is totally invisible when applied. it doesn't stain or leave residue on my clothing, not even when i wear dark colors. this is not a natural deodorant given additives like propylene glycol and sulfates, but it is free of fragrance and controversial aluminum and parabens. i think this vichy stick deodorant is excellent and definitely recommend it for men and women. made in france.",2017-06-13,5,5,A2L6BT1PVV9YN0,B006989VBG

3877,"this product worked very well for me. i was a little bit hesitant to try it because i had a severe rash from a similar product years ago. however, though i felt a little irritation the first time i used it, i had no real reaction to it, even after using it for a week. i wore the product in a number of situations; notably, wearing a polyester fabric ( which seems to almost amplify the effects of sweaty skin) in a stifling hot room for 5 or 6 hours. i was very pleased with the product's lack of perfume and its effectiveness. i dropped one star for the price, which is pretty high, though this sort of product will last a long time.

the initial smell is astringent and, generally, unpleasant, couple with the fact it seems to have little effect, making this a hard pass.

3892,"first of all, i have used many products made by vichy so i always have great expectations being that all the products i have owned made by them have been excellent.  i am not disappointed here either.

vichy products tend to be very pure; they are gentle, and without much scent, or they have no scent at all.  the consistency of these products have been lighter than normal beauty substances, not reeking of chemicals, and non comedogenic.  i haven't reacted to any of them yet, including this product.  this product is not going to taint your clothing in my opinion, and it makes sense for a stay-dry deodorant to not have too much stickiness or waxiness - ya know - it might defeat the purpose.

no aluminum!  this is a cancer-causing agent if i am not mistaken, and i am happy to not have this substance in my maximum stay-dry deodorant.

the mechanism used to crank out this solid works very well.  sometimes i will get a deodorant solid which is difficult to maneuver.

the ingredients list is more benign in my opinion than popular deodorant brands'.  you will see what i mean about the purity.  also, i have used it already two days now with good results.

3894,"24 hour protection? i don't think so. by the mid-afternoon on a normal day, i can detect some slight bo already. my wife concurs. it works, but not very well and it is hard to justify the price. this is for users who want to avoid aluminum salts and other potentially hazardous ingredients found in the cheaper, more common and more effective standard deodorants. and no, it isn't an anti-perspirant either. it does go on gently and feels good, and doesn't have much of, if any, scent.

3895,"edited to add:  i wanted to note that this deodorant still works well for me but i did notice some odor today after a long day at work.  we'd had spicy food the night before, so that might have contributed a bit.

original notes:

i normally wear inexpensive deodorants that are heavy on the fragrance.  i could buy several of them for the cost of a single stick of this solid variety from vichy.  that said, i am so impressed by the effectiveness of this variety!  it goes on super smooth.  in terms of size it's already smaller than grocery store brands, and when i apply it , it actually feels like it's depositing something under my arms.  somehow it's satisfying and assuring that you can feel it going on.  with the cheap stuff, i feel compulsive about swiping on multiple times in a large area for more coverage.  with the vichy stick it goes on easily and i don't feel the need to cover the area over and over again.

i live in nwfl so the days are already climbing to the high 80's most days.  having a good deodorant is paramount.  i'm accustomed to that meaning an overly scented stick that might need to be re-applied mid day.  this stick has no fragrance that i can detect.  after a normal day with little exertion, i still smell fresh as a daisy.  but after a lengthy house cleaning session and working up a considerable sweat, i am even happier to note that i still smell clean and neutral.  there's no bo and there's no overly cloying floral fragrance lingering trying to mask my natural smell.  i'm impressed and already planning to buy more.",2017-06-04,4,5,A3IUW081KXD3PE,B006989VBG
3896,"pricey, but this deodorant worked so well for me. fragrance-free, no rashes, no sweat marks and no stink!  i will buy again as it works for me when 2 of former go-to brands have stopped being effective.",2017-06-04,4,5,A3Z9QN0RCOHEY,B006989VBG
3897,"i didn't like this product at all.  when applied, it felt like a soft balm which felt very nice, at first.  but after awhile i noticed that my underarms were very sticky.  not only sticky to the touch but sticky when i moved my arms.  it feels very weird to have the skin under your arms sticking together.

and to top it off, it didn't control odor.  i showered before bed and applied this deodorant and woke up with smelly armpits.  and our bedroom is a very comfortable 65-67 degrees.  (it's late spring/early summer here and we sleep with the windows open so it's not like i'm sweating excessively while i  sleep.)",2017-06-01,1,1,A15T9G38F589KM,B006989VBG

3977,"i used this for three-weeks. here are the positives and the negatives (in my opinion):

positives:
-dries clear (does not stain or mark clothing). love this!
-once it dries, it is nearly undetectable to touch. (it's a pleasant change not to have a sticky underarm like with some dove or degree versions.)
-a bit of a healthier version of a deodorant.

negatives:
-strong smell (that diminishes after a few hours).
-the price is crazy (like full-on crazy for what the consumer receives).
-good for lazy days, not-so-great for active days.
-does not last for 24 hours.

i will use the entire container for days when i'm planning on catching up reading (but definitely not on gym days!). but, i cannot envision buying this for this price ... ever.",2015-12-09,3,5,A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M,B006989VBG

(nice word - splendid)  it's definitely a frost, and i find it streaks a little, but i'm not a professional, so that's fine for me.  i'm just thrilled to death i finally found a color that isn't goth or weird or screaming for attention.  i like subtle and refined, and this is it!  it's so pretty!",2016-02-13,5,5,A1S71R4YJDJMAD,B00699JDKY

bottom line, it does work but is it worth it? if you've tried many other, less expensive deodorants and they didn't work, this might be worth trying.",2015-10-28,4,3,AGA7LFNS3YUXC,B006989VBG

however, i know better than to expect it to hold up in heavy exercise or hot weather.  that's not what this is made for.

i expect this bottle to last quite a long time.  so it's a decent value.

i am always looking for new deodorants that don't contain aluminum - a chemical that some say may cause health issues.  we all know the science of "this is safe (wait five-10 years) oh, never mind it's not safe"  so i try to use less aluminum.",2015-10-23,5,5,A33JGP7NR4BV8W,B006989VBG
3993,"it is not sticky like most of the bar deodorants out there.  application was clean, and it washed off after one shower, unlike my old spice which required multiple scrubs to remove from my skin.

the active ingredient is perlite- volcanic glass.  perlite itself has 12% aluminum content, but is not nearly as high as the aluminum content from regular deodorants.  there is debate about whether or not aluminum is linked to alzheimer's, and i am always on the lookout for effective, low aluminum deodorant.  with the low aluminum content, you are going to get decreased efficacy.  make sure to reapply more than once a day if you plan to sweat a lot.

the smell is like baby powder, and definitely recommended for women instead of men.

if you have been using aluminum deodorants it may take a little while for a non- aluminum one to work. it's almost like you have to get them out of your system for others to work.

the price on this is quite high. also, if you need directions, there are none in english on this container.  this product's container was not sealed in any way so if that is a concern of yours, that might be an issue.

i'd definitely buy this if i could find a better price. it works well for me. good for my sensitive skin and doesn't have ingredients i don't need.",2015-10-16,4,5,AQY5XBYSENNZQ,B006989VBG

4141,"first off, i love the color.  i don't have anything like this and i used it immediately upon receiving it (it was june's high shine club selection for me).

i did have to use 3-4 coats to really get it to be opaque, but light colors are often like that for me.  i think i am going to try it in the future over an opaque white polish; it should look great that way.  it was a good texture when wet (not too thin or too thick) and was easy to apply and i like the brush.  the finish on my nails is super smooth.

however, i did get chips on a couple of fingernails within 24 hours.  i had tried to be careful, and my nails aren't that long, so this was a little disappointing.  i touched up with new polish in the chipped areas and it's hard to tell i did any touch up unless you get really close.  so, i think my manicure will still last for a few days, though i expect to have to do more touch-ups now.  (i did peel a whole bunch of oranges and the polish didn't get messed up, so that was nice.)

i used a seche vite quick-dry topcoat with this.  i do have an essie topcoat and i may try that next time to see if staying within one brand results in increased performance.  overall, however, i'm pretty happy with this.",2014-06-25,4,3,A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,B00699JDKY

4181,"i like wearing neutral color on my nails and i usually love essie.  i went with this color to get some subtle glitter.  i was disappointed with the product.  it goes on with lots of streaks.  it needs at least 3 coats to get the right coverage and the nice milky pink finish.  i stay away from 3 coats for nail polish because it doesn't last as long.  the good thing about this color is that it wears well meaning that chipped color doesn't show.  i wore it for almost a week, so that's good.  i doubt that i would have been able to do it with 3 coats, but i will experiment.  it is a good color for the office, but i still wish that it was less "watery".",2014-03-14,2,3,A3M1HYKCHSN11D,B00699JDKY

i'm a huge essie fan and it saddens me because this looks like such a great color and they currently do not offer anything close to it.  i have discontinued colors that are similar but don't have the punch that this one has.",2014-02-04,1,3,AM0OKL6AFIBDX,B00699JDKY

4311,"dj play that song is a semi-neon purple color with red undertones. i say semi because it's not a blazing neon. it can be worn to work. it looks just like it is pictured in the bottle - pinkish purple. i tried to take pics after applying but my camera wouldn't capture the real color. i tried in sun/shade/indoors/lights.. but didn't work. the color is really pretty to naked eye.

saturday disco fever is a bright pure orange color. this is not a very blazing neon, so i am able to wear it to work. it looks fabulous in sunlight as well as indoors. i felt that this color is more suitable for evenings and parties in summer. i was a little apprehensive at first because i personally don't like yellow/orange shades. but this color worked for me. it is more red-toned than yellow-toned. this dark orange looks good on nails too.

the formula on both the polishes is great. two coats are enough for perfect opaque polish. they dry quickly but dry matty-ish. so top coat is a must for me. i applied a base coat (opi base coat), 2 coats of polish and a top coat (opi top coat). they lasted more than a week on me which is rare :-).",2013-06-19,5,5,A3HU9KQ2AO7Q22,B00699JDKY

*preliminary review which i have to retract* this baxter comb comes in its own little box, printed with little blurb about the hand crafted care that goes into it's manufacture.  it is light weight and flexible so as not to break in your back pocket.  my husband says this comb is noticeably nicer than the dime store one he's been using for years.  he says the teeth feel smooth on his scalp and glide nicely thorough his hair, though i fear there may be more words in this review than there are hairs on his head these days....",2014-01-04,1,3,A28TWWUAWFVCTR,B0079K5ZPY

i was shocked at how small this would be, but i guess i shouldn't be considering it's for beards and moustaches. it fits great in my fingers, and really keeps my moustache combed to either side. i primarily use the narrower teeth, but i'm sure the thicker end would be great for bushier moustaches or beards.

4326,"most people are familiar with combs sold by places that advertise "everyday discounts."  what many people may not know is that much higher quality combs are available.  the combs in "everyday discount" stores are typically mass-produced, injection molded plastic with sufficient post-production processing to make the comb usable, and little more.  generally, the combs from such places border on being disposable.

finding high quality combs is relatively easy, but you have to seek them out.  specialty stores have them, and amazon has them.  outside of a beauty shop or a barber shop, this comb from baxter of california is the highest quality comb i have seen in some time.  the comb feels solid and is extremely smooth.  the ends of the teeth are smooth, as the molding seams have been carefully removed.  the comb is beautiful; nearly a wok of art.  some people have called the coloration tortoise shell.  call it whatever you like, but call it beautiful.

of course, the comb has an end with the teeth close together, and an end with the teeth further apart, depending on what kind of hair you have and the effect you are trying to achieve.  so the comb is functional as well as beautiful.  this comb is one that you will use for many years.

does this comb have any downsides?  as much as i would like to have this comb fit into my pocket, this comb was never intended to go into a pocket.  it will fit into a handbag, or be a great asset in a beauty shop, in a dressing room, or a bathroom.  indeed, you may wish to place this comb in a place where it will be visible so that visitors can admire it.

beauty, quality, and functionality all combined into one bundle.  while this comb is more expensive than the bags of combs you can buy in discount stores, this comb will be something you will want to use for years, or even decades, and each time you use it you will marvel at how good it feels when you comb your hair.  conversely, if you ever lose this comb, you will miss it the first time you run a cheap comb through your hair.

this comb is not one of those items, it looks like it was made to be good, and it is indeed good.  it feels solid, has heft, the tines are nicely rounded.  it's a very simple item made to near the best it can be, and many levels above your standard dollar store comb.  this should last forever, and be a joy to use during that time.",2014-02-18,5,5,AMS2CPERWN7JV,B0079K5ZPY

4332,"i'm cheap. i buy my combs for 99 cents in a two-pack, and get grumpy when i lose them. when i got to opportunity to try a high quality one for free, i was both excited that i wouldn't have to spend money, and i was a little smug about trying a comb that goes for around $20.

i've had this comb for just over 2 weeks, and i will now not be without it. at home i use it for sectioning and combing my hair out while ironing it, and out and about it's in my purse to keep my picky bangs in order. it's beautiful, it's strong-- this comb does not bend, and it's thickness is amazing. it's also the first comb i can use as a brush- i have a ton of hair, but it's fairly fine. i use the wide set teeth side to detangle, then the closely set ones to style. i kind of hate hair brushes, now.

i will never lose this comb because it's changed the way i deal with and treat my hair. if you're like me with your budget, i will tell you it's worth it- it will treat your hair/beard very well, and last probably until the earth melts/explodes/freezes. some things are worth a splurge because of their long lasting quality, and i now know this baxter of california (but made by the swiss, oooo!) comb falls into that category.",2014-01-31,5,5,A2VQVI5X3VTDT3,B0079K5ZPY

4334,"useless history: i started growing a mustache in senior year of high school - back in the day when doing such things would get you a trip to the principal's office. my favorite photo is a shot of me was taken at the hs senior prom - me in a white tux carrying a cocktail glass, smoking a cheap cigar and sporting an embarrassingly thin bit of fuzz on my upper lip. that was long enough ago that i would plead the 5th if asked the date that picture was taken. back then, i quickly learned that simply lathering up my face and shaving everything smooth was fast and simple - in ad-speak, "low maintenance". however, because i was stubborn (then as now), i refused to give up on growing facial hair and by mid freshman year in college, i had a decent mustache. that's when i learned that these things required "high maintenance". the first indication was when i had my first bowl of creamy new england clam chowder and had to use a pile of napkins to keep my clearly-too-long whiskers clean. my solution - a trip into nyc to buy a really nice pair of hoffitz scissors to trim my luxuriant facial hair. as a fun gift, my girl friend gave me a tiny mustache maintenance kit that consisted of a small mirror and a tiny comb - all neatly packaged in a plastic tube. those items made staying groomed properly easier. in fact, a history professor pulled me aside after class one day and asked how i kept my "stash" so neat. alas, that cool little mustache comb disappeared over the years but when i saw the baxter beard comb, i had a flash back to my salad days. naturally, i had to have it.

hands on: getting the tiny comb out of the tiny, shrink-wrapped box required the aid of a pocket knife. trust me, it's definitely worth the effort because, holding it in your hand, you realize that you have a remarkable work of art in front of you. the plastic material is highly polished (rather than molded) and the teeth hand cut - again, not molded. the overall length is just a smidgen over 3 inches so it's pretty small. but the size makes working in the tight space under my nose easy. call it right-sized.

recommendation: duck dynasty stars aside, if you have a mustache and beard, you will need to trim them. how you do that is as personal as the style, size and shape of your facial hair. i still have a high quality pair of scissors secreted away so that it doesn't get used for anything other than hair grooming and now, i have a wonderful little gem of a comb keeping it company to use while i do this all important grooming task.

final thoughts: if you don't have facial hair - move on. else, give this neat little comb a look.",2014-01-30,4,5,A3CJ7MHAS9IMAM,B0079K5ZPY
4335,"this comb sells for about 18$. i have never owned a comb that expensive before. is it worth it? oh yes. i have waist length fine hair that is a snarl waiting to happen. all my other combs have teeth missing from tangles and knots. no matter how much conditioner i use, my hair is a trial. this comb is a miracle. there are no rough edges on the teeth and it just glides through my hair. it doesn't rip any hair out like my other combs. i am thrilled with it.

this large comb is perfect for me and all my hair; the company also sells pocket comb versions which may be better for short hair or carrying on your person. the large comb is 7.75" and is great if you carry a bag. i also want to comment about the packaging. this comb came shrink wrapped in a box with an additional inner sleeve. probably too much but it certainly reflected the pride in manufacturing and the sense that this comb was mine alone. i felt a moment of nostalgia for a time past of craftsmanship. i smile when i look at it. i am pleased to own such a wonderful product and very happy to recommend it to others.",2014-01-30,5,5,AQY5XBYSENNZQ,B0079K5ZPY

what distinguishes this comb from others?
it is made of a thicker, stronger plastic, making the bristles inflexible and less prone to warping, as cheap combs will do. likewise, the bristles are rounded at the ends and smooth along all surfaces, making it less likely to catch on or cut strands of hair. other than that, the design is basically the same, and you can get one of a similar quality for much less at a sally's or other beauty supply place.

4345,"this comb is attractive and has a nice weight and shape to it.  only you can decide if it's worth the price over a drugstore comb, but the main differences are (1) weight (2) how finely rounded the edges are.

the comb feels substantial and it's size makes it easy to grip.  any comb will probably do the job of getting out tangles, but the tines of this comb feel smoother on the scalp and has a nicer weight to it than comparably-sized combs that are less expensive.

the acetate material will become slightly cloudy from combing action (hair being pulled along the frame will cause fine scratches that remove some of the out-of-the-box shine), but it doesn't affect the generally attractive tortoiseshell appearance.

another thing to note is that i have owned a similar comb by a british company (kent brushes), and cellulose acetate is no more durable (in fact, it may even be more brittle) than harder plastics.

overall, i recommend this comb, but i'm sure it's worth the sticker price.

edited to add: i've had this comb for over a year and it still looks and works great.  prefer it to other combs i've had and thus for durability i'm upgrading it to 5 stars (instead of the 4 stars in my original review).",2014-01-06,5,5,A1CEG62GJ3BI5U,B0079K5ZPY
4346,"a normal comb with narrowly set teeth at one end and wider set teeth on the other, this is very well finished.
if you've gotten inexpensive pocket combs and styling combs before you know that they can be sharp and snag hair. they frequently have mold marks which can damage your hair and scalp.

i use a strand of fine spun yarn on my own combs to check between the teeth for rough spots that can catch or pull hair- this comb passed that test easily without a snag to be seen. the teeth are evenly spaced, and tapered to rounded ends, no risk of scratching your scalp even if you do a firm slicked backed hair style.

the weight is substantial for a comb, and the acetate feels very rigid compared to the softer plastics that make up some combs. that's a good thing.

it's meant for shorter hair styles- but i tried it on my own waist length hair after detangling with a wide tooth comb. it glided through my hair without any problems. to be honest, i baby my hair and hand finish a lot of my combs using wet-dry sand paper in a couple grades to get them really smooth, and this is a comb i was happy to use straight out of the box. i'll be using it for sleek styles, but i fully expect my husband will use it as well. comb and brush quality, like a lot of other things, is reflected in the price. a well finished comb is going to cost more but it will be better for your hair, and can last a lifetime.",2014-01-06,5,5,A1GYEGLX3P2Y7P,B0079K5ZPY
4347,"i am a 42 year old woman who has been shaving daily for 25+ years. i started off shaving with just plain bar soap and moved on to canned barbasol cream, which i've used for probably the last 20 years. my skin is dry and somewhat prone to irritation/razor burn, although not truly sensitive. lately i have also been experiencing some irritation and itching on my lower legs, which i attributed to winter dryness. a friend recently mentioned that his wife shaves with his proraso soap, so i decided to give it a try. my husband gave me a quick tutorial on lathering, gave me a shave brush & lather bowl, and i gave it a shot. i'm very impressed with this soap. it lathers up quickly and easily, and has a creamy, rich consistency. i didn't find it overly mentholated or irritating - in fact, i barely noticed the menthol at all. i had concerns that it would over-dry my skin, and while it was definitely not hydrating, it also didn't dry me out. no nicks or cuts, no irritation. the first time out, i got one of the closest shaves i've ever had, and that was with a several days old cheap disposable razor. the next morning my legs were still smooth & stubble-free, which is unheard of for me. and that lower leg irritation i previously mentioned? completely gone since switching to this soap. i have tried using this soap both with a secondary lather bowl, and with lathering directly on the skin with a brush. i personally think the bowl method works better, especially for legs, as it produces a thicker, more creamy lather. and as someone who is usually in a rush in the mornings, i should note that using this soap & a brush doesn't take me any longer than using my old canned shave cream. the frugal side of me appreciates that this one bowl of soap will probably last me 2-3 months of daily shaving, as i only need a small amount each day. there's also less packaging & waste compared to my old canned cream. i've already ordered the red & white proraso soaps to try.",2018-02-21,5,1,A1O4PNHACFEDEM,B00837YY18

4349,"hope all of you are having a great shave! in this review i will touch upon some tips to follow to maintain the longevity of this soap in particular. if you're wanting to know more about the philosophy of the proraso company and how it is presented in the shaving industry, then i would advise you to check my detailed review of the proraso red or the sandalwood proraso tub.

my first experience of this soap ties me to another review i just posted for the proraso pre shave cream in the green tub. i linked this soap to its pre shaving cream for the purpose of how different each component plays an important role in terms of scent and performance. the green shaving soap is different from the cream through one clear factor. the shaving soap is more soapy in scent and less cologne, in other words it's more fresh scented, mildly in strength and powdery to the nostrils than the pre shaving cream. usually one would say both products should be identical well not here with proraso. that's why i love this company because each single product holds its own line of effect and performance.
 the pre shave cream is there for the face prep and therefore it will give you the first wiff of what is yet to come. holding that sensational pleasant feel, by introducing the soap, you will add another layer of experience. the luxurious sheen and cushion will be calmly interlinked with the cream in a pleasant marriage. you will know when the soap is added by just the smell of it. some people might shy away from the handful usage of menthol products, i have to say no to the case of this brand, the shave was still pleasant and the menthol didn't overwhelm my nostrils and eyes. when i combined both shockingly the only difference was the change in sent and the menthol sensation through the three passes didn't tone down or built up it stayed the same.

some shaving soaps in the industry have a repeating trend of building up the effect of coolness by every pass in a shave. when combining the two products of this company the soap and pre shave , you get something those companies fail to accomplish, the word is consistency and balance. i have tried blooming this soap for one reason, although it's a soft soap i wanted to experience more to what this soap has to offer. the slickness was intensified by this soap alone, i did this once without using the pre shaving cream. it was a delight!

now in order to maintain the life and performance of this product i would like to share with you some tips that you will find useful. after i load my brush with any soap i directly rinse the tub clean from the excess soap with water. i then place it face down on a towel. i leave it over night to air dry, never leave your tub facing upwards; this will force the water to stay submerged in the soap and what you will end up with is a slimy gooey substance, nearly half eaten soap. the water will react to soap like it reacts to soaps in general. you will dinimish the longevity of this product and in less than 10 shaves you will find yourself with an empty tub sooner than you know it. this soap can last forever if maintained properly.
never load the brush and close the tub immediately; by doing so you are creating a vacuum area and a chance for bacteria to form with the foam that is already on the tub that was formed while loading the brush. this is very important to have in mind because this bacteria can give us a bad shaving experience and increase the chance of our faces getting infected this is not a common happening but science does tell us that bacteria of some sorts do effect our skin. so just be careful.

so by placing the tub downwards and leaving it to naturally air dry you will allow whatever water to go down naturally with the effect of gravity and you will be able to maintain a safe product to be used on your face every time you shave, for a long long time. people often get nervous especially ones like me that own over 60 soaps and by looking at the expiry date they tend to have the urge to rush and finish a product without enjoying it. guys this is a soap. it's enemy is water. as long as it is dry , soaps can last for years and years. they are even selling vintage soaps 60 years old plus on ebay. you find people paying rediculous amounts on auctions. why? because they are soaps. if maintained you can use them for decades! one shaving soap you can browse on ebay auctions is the vintage shelton known as the might old spice. if you find a nos ( new old stock soap with its cup and sealed...) do me a favor and check the price on it. people in the wet shaving community live by collecting these.

another tip i gathered while shaving through the year that i would like to add here because of the special package of this product is once you finish this soap don't discard the container,,, keep it! there are countless options for using this tub to me i use it to put in another soap, sometimes it's cheaper to purchase a refill, instead of buying a soap with a tub. there are some cases where you can save yourself a minimum of 60 bucks with a refill. some companies add a lot of money to a soap by shoving in a ceramic bowl, a wooden bowl, or a bowl that they created from heaven. in the end of the day it's just a soap. a wooden bowl might expand and crack if you bloom the soap in it or by just exposing it to the slightest drop of water.  the ceramic bowl might break and shatter with your slippery hands while loading the brush. always think positive. why i say this with proraso is because unlike other plastic products out there, this is well created product and is a good grade of plastic that can be used over and over again with no worries of getting any chemical reactions to the soap.

this whole idea of wet shaving should add pleasure to your life. it's really beneficial for your skin health, and boy you will love it! shave on! ladies and gents!

ps. there is one thing i want to say, is if you ever want to purchase a shaving soap from proraso, is get this one before you head to the sandalwood red tub, why? because there have been countless rumors and complaints across the web of people actually having their face irritated by getting a slight burning sensation on their face while placing the red tub lather. some might say it's the contents found in the ingredients of the tub, and they end up praising this green one. to me it's not the case, i have found both scents and types a pleasure to shave with even with my extra sensitive skin and hard stiff stubble. to me it's all about face prep, and that comes before anything else. to me it actually improved my shaves and experiences drastically. plus we only have one face for god's sake. so to put all mysteries aside i actually recommend you to give this tub a try first and then move the red tub.

4350,"proraso white soap was the first real shaving product i tried - about 3 years ago, right when i quit the razor cartridges for good and switched to double edge safety razors and straight edge. that remains my favorite scent and it motivated me to try other proraso products and other soaps.

i have about every proraso product at this point and their soaps and creams perform very similar to me (good), so other than that it's mostly about scent.

i was hesitatnt to try proraso green, because i thought i wouldn't like the scent (afraid i'd get the blast of toothpaste-like smell). it turned out to be very pleasant and refreshing - great for warm weather. the soap still has a classy "barbershop" scent, yet without feeling like an old geezer. i find that the scent of green does not linger quite like the white and red, which is perhaps good, because the scent of the green tonic (splash) is great! the days that i use all of the green products, i do it because i look forward to the splash - it lingers for hours and is like a classy cologne (and not exactly similar to menthol/eucalyptus you get here. the green preshave/soap/cream and balm smell more medicine-y, in a pleasant way. the green splash (lozione) is more like perfume.

i love it for the price.

4356,"the product comes in the hard plastic bowl shaped container as pictured. the lid just kind of snaps onto the container and is easy enough to open and close. when you open the container the minty menthol smell is very prominent. the shave soap has a firm texture.

i lather and apply this product using a separate cup and synthetic badger brush. first, i soak my brush in warm water while i am showering. next, i squeeze out most of the water but not all of it. now it is time to load the brush, i firmly push it into the shave soap and brush it in a clockwise motion for a while. once it is nice and loaded i build a good lather. to build my lather i start running my brush in a clockwise motion inside my lather cup. i add a few drops of hot water throughout the lather building process. i keep working it in the shave bowl until i get a nice creamy dollop of shaving awesomeness. finally, it is time to get this on my face. i just simply wet my face with warm/hot water and thoroughly brush on the lathered shave soap. i usually shave in three passes and just rinse and reload my face after each pass.

this shave soap lathers wonderfully and goes onto my face well. it gives a nice smooth layer of protection. my skin is more on the sensitive side so i was apprehensive about using a menthol product. i do not seem to have too much of an adverse reaction to this product except for some tingling in my face. this container seems to last forever, way longer than any of the canned gel junk you can buy.

4365,"with over 30 years of scraping sharpened steel across my face, i've come to the conclusion that the key to a close, comfortable shave is less about the razor and its blades as it is about the lubrication provided by the soap or cream being used.  i purchased a tub of prorasso eucalyuptus and menthol 5 months ago, have been using it daily and i'm pleasantly surprised by the results.

what it is:

- a plastic tub holding 5.2 oz. of softened shaving soap.  a shaving brush can be "loaded" right in the tub.

teaching an old dog new tricks:

- fleeing the disposable razor cult allowed me to see that there was a better shaving world out there.  the old method of spraying a glob of gel, smearing it all over my face and using that single application to shave my skin from every direction is officially over.  no more dragging a blade across unlubricated skin after the initial "with the grain" shaving pass removed all the cream ... not good.  sure, it got the job done, but my skin burned, there was irritation around my neck and there were annoying "rough" patches left behind (because not all hairs grown in the same direction).  to be honest, i never thought of adding a second, third or even fourth application of gel for the subsequent "against the grain", "from the side" and "touch-up" passes ... using a can of shaving gel a week wasn't appealing and i never saw anyone else do it.  there had to be a better way to shave.

why proraso:

- first of all, this stuff has been around forever; it's an icon of shaving.  honestly, in this day and age, that means something ...

- unlike most every shaving gel/cream/soap i'd used over the years, proraso provides a rich lather without "glopping up" my razor and that helps prolong the effectiveness of the blade.  a simple rinse clears any soap and hair buildup on the blade(s).

- i can swirl a wet shaving brush directly into the tub of proraso for several seconds and get enough soap to squeeze out four facial applications to provide enough lubrication for my four shaving passes (with the grain, against the grain, from the side and touch ups).  no more dry shaves!

- one tub of proraso has lasted 5 months and counting (shaving daily)!

- the refreshing eucalyptus and menthol provide a cool, refreshing and tingling sensation to the skin that becomes more pronounced with each subsequent application.  the fourth (final) application is when the menthol's coolness really kicks in.

while i have gladly been using a double-edge safety razor for the last 6 months, i would highly recommend proraso to compliment any shave, regardless of the razor being used.  i believe the most crucial element of a quality close shave is the lubrication factor of the shaving cream as it allows the razor to do its work without damaging your skin.  proraso provides the necessary lubrication without mucking up your blades and this means your blades last longer.  longer blade life and the ability to get up to 6 months of daily shaving from a single tub of proraso should certainly lessen the financial burden of shaving.  the best aspect, however, is the ability to get a really close (baby smooth) shave without irritating the skin.",2014-12-03,5,5,A2IMGHMF0LO151,B00837YY18

used with my gillette fusion razor, it gives me the most luxurious and closest shaves i've had in my 68 years on the planet. i wore a beard for close to 30 years, but now i actually look forward to shaving.

4377,"a saw that the proraso shaving soap was frequently purchased with the merkur safety razor i was purchasing, so i decided to give it a go since it was less expensive than the shaving cream from the body shop i was using at the time.  up until now i have been using other brands of shaving creams that i applied with a brush, but none of them compare to the great shave i get with the proraso shaving soap.

i only need to run my shaving brush in the soap dish a little to be able to achieve a full lather when i apply the shaving soap to my face.  the soap gives a bit of a tingling feeling which is nice.  using this soap, i think that i can achieve a closer shave than with shaving creams.

the proraso shaving soap has a nice scent which basically smells like soap.  i have gotten comments on the scent from other people.  plus the proraso shaving soap doesnt have a bad affect my skin.  i have tried some creams such as the baxter of california super close shave formula which caused my skin to break out horribly.

overall, this is by far my favorite shaving soap.  using this soap with my safety razor and a feather shaving blade, i am able to achieve a close shave that doesnt leave my skin irritated.  i highly recommend this product.",2013-11-21,5,5,ACHTDPEQYSEQL,B00837YY18

4381,"after having a beard and using an electric shaver to shave around its edges for decades i decided to go clean shaven for a while.  at first i tried conventional shave cream along with multi-blade razors, which worked okay.  but recently i decided to go back to the distant past and start shaving with a double edge safety razor and old-time bowl soap.  i went to my local wal-mart and tried the van der hagen soap at first.  it was very inexpensive and felt good but did not lather well at all.  after reading reviews about proraso shaving soap i decided to give it a try.  i'm glad i did.  it comes in a nice plastic bowl with a lid making a separate shaving mug kind of unnecessary.  it lathers well, and i like how it feels on my skin.  maybe it's just me, but it seems like i could shave a lot closer with it.  since i only just recently started using it i can't say how long the soap will last, but the amount supplied appears to be about 1-1/2 times the amount in the van der hagen product.  i would expect it to last 6 months or more at least.  the price is about 5 times as much, but i think it's worth its added cost.  if you try it, i think you will like it.",2013-03-16,5,3,ATLA5CJH0ZZHP,B00837YY18

1) spf 30 - it's difficult to find a daytime moisturizer than can protect me from the sun without my skin breaking out and this one does just that. according to the instructions, it should be applied every two hours but i do not have time for that. i apply in the morning, 30 minutes before heading out and that's that. it has been sufficient for me and i love how my skin feels.
2) there is a flat plastic applicator included so that i don't have to scoop in with my fingers and get product under my nails (which i hate). very useful.
the smell is faintly reminiscent of the sea but for some reason, after application, i am reminded of wet pavement. it's not .
i have been applying this now for about 2 months on my face, neck, decolletage and hands.  while i do feel super-moisturized and protected, i have yet to notice any firming transformations.

4390,"this is a sunscreen before it is a moisturizer. it absolutely has the feel and scent of a sunscreen and lays on the face like a sunscreen rather than a moisturizer. the active ingredients in it are sunscreen agents, so that tells you something right there.

there's no way i would use or recommend this as an everyday moisturizer or firming moisturizer. as a sunscreen for summer or sunny months, it is fine and may have some skin improving properties on top of being a sunscreen. for everyday, year round use, i cant see using it. it has the heavy feel and texture of a sunscreen and the same sort of layer on the skin, rather than absorbing into the skin like a moisturizer should. it also has the same slightly greasy/slick feel that a sunscreen does.... because it is a sunscreen.

i think it would be much better marketed as a sunscreen rather than a moisturizer which has sunscreen in it. again, go right back to the ingredients and see for yourself - the active ingredients are sunscreens. then there is a list of inactive ingredients which are a combination of typical moisturizer ingredients as well as other ingredients found in sunscreens.",2017-12-13,3,3,A1QBOC76MIOJYP,B009S7H0UE

4392,"i was very pleased with this face cream.  i have severely dry skin in the winter, and often times moisturizers (even nice ones) tend to ball up when you rub them in and contain mostly water - so they evaporate fast and don't provide a lot of benefit.

this cream is thick.  it looks opaque coming out of the jar and you barely need a fingertip full to apply over your entire face.  i love that, because it means i won't go through the entire pot in a week.  it has a distinctive smell, but i didn't mind it at all.  most of the ones i really dislike have a sugary floral smell and this was more like a chemical/botanical smell.  it goes away after a minute or two.

the sunscreen is excellent.  as i get older it becomes more of a priority to me to protect my skin whenever i get the chance.  i can sunscreen my face and neck area fully with this cream, with no stickiness or residue getting on my clothes.

i'm not sure whether this has any actual anti-aging properties because that tends to be hard to confirm.  what i can confirm is that this is a heavy, smooth-applying cream that lasts and keeps moisture in through the day.",2017-12-11,5,5,A2VHQDJBZH0Y7P,B009S7H0UE

i dab on a minimal amount, (probably less than what's called for in the instructions), and it soaks in almost immediately.  by the time i've unscrewed the cap of my foundation, this moisturizer has soaked in and my skin is ready for the color.  it is amazing how quickly my skin texture goes from that dry morning leathery look, to fresh, bright and plumped out.  it's easier to apply my foundation, too.

it is not at all greasy.  it goes on white (due to the sunscreen in it), but the opaqueness disappears immediately.  i usually break out from using a new moisturizer, but that was never a problem with this.  my skin is totally free of blemishes, and that is rare.

what i noticed is my facial skin felt tighter. and my skin felt moisturized at the same time. one doesn't usually experience tightness with so much moisturizing effect. i can see why she makes a big deal about it.",2017-11-20,5,5,A3NHUQ33CFH3VM,B009S7H0UE

my reason for taking off a star is that it's five times or more the price of my oil of olay daytime cream. hard to swallow that price tag. if you find other lower quality creams are not working out so well for you, then maybe this one would be worth it.  just not for me.",2017-02-17,4,4,AUV3OR951650C,B00AAR9I60
4421,"for a week and a half, i used this as my sole moisturizer. i paired it with the obagi foaming gel (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b00f6xznoo), and some vitamin c serum, but avoided all my other products in order to see what this stuff really does.

like most face products, any directions given are mostly useless. in the morning and evening or as needed. really, no kidding. how much should i use? no clue. so for about a week i used a full pump, then it seemed that might take me through the bottle too quick, so i cut back to about half that.
i used it every morning and every night, but im going to stop that. ill use it every other night or maybe just a couple times a week to refresh my skin.

first, i didn't break out at all. normally i do when i switch face products. so thats a plus!
second, this stuff does feel hydrating. my face seemed to like it. i don't notice any particular softness but i also didn't dry out. its not greasy.
i didn't notice any particular improvement in my skin condition, but also it didn't hurt at all.

so 4-stars?
well, i think it does what it claims, which is simple. hydrate = check!
but all the ingredients make for an odd smell. its not scented, it just has a sort of buttery/flour-like smell. it definitely applies like a shea butter, really smooth and soft. so, i took out a star for the smell.

also, there seem to be a lot of reviews that mention obagi or obaji. those are two different names, so im not sure if that has something to do with it, but there are also several people who have used obagi from doctors offices and say this is different. currently, this item is showing as unavailable on amazon, with no distributor.

there is very little odor to this moisturizer, thank heavens, as i have had to get up and wash my face in the middle of the night because of the cloying odor of other moisturizers i used.  it goes on smoothly and leaves a non-oily matte finish, making it the perfect primer for foundation or wearing without any makeup at all.  i have older skin which is a combination of oily and dry, with the classic t-zone of oiliness. this product seemed to keep down the oil while hydrating the dry areas. just right!

my only concern with this product is the warning on the bottle to keep it away from your eyes and away from children. it's kind of hard to put on a facial moisturizer without getting it in your eyes, but i put it on very carefully, then use a specific eye moisturizer afterward.  plus, it's a little pricey, but not too bad considering what other high-end moisturizers go for.

this 1.7 ounce pump style container will not last long as it's simply not a large amount of product.  it's called "hydrate" but i don't see how all these heavy butters and gums can hydrate my face.  it feels like a lotion one should put on their skin when out in the sun, but not something to use as a facial moisturizer.

skin but when i learned recently about parabens, which are lab made preservatives that have been
found in breast cancer tumors, etc, i threw all of it out.  i needed to take a break from the nuderm
system anyways and my skin was where it needed to be.

my friend, whom i introduced obagi to, got this hydrate from her aesthetician's office and told me
that it was paraben free! she loves it so i thought i'd give it a try on the evenings sunscreen isn't
needed and to alleviate my dry chin and mouth area. i bought it here on amazon and saved $12 instead
of buying it at my dermatologists office! yes!!!!

i have used it about 3-4 times and i used it last night and i woke up this morning and the skin around
my mouth and chin was flaky. unsure if it this is meant to be just an "as-needed" spot treatment for dryness
instead of as a night cream. this does go on silky though and it reminds me of how those
dymethicone products feel. it has no scent which i am very glad about. and i have not tried to wear it in the
morning/daytime because i wear an spf 30 under my tinted moisturizer.

i am currently on image skincare products and love it but some of my sun spots have come back even though
i do use spf 30 every single day so i want to eventually go back to the obagi nuderm line but i refuse
to until they make the entire line paraben free. (not only are parabens found in paraben users breast and
other cancerous tumors but is also found to raise estrogen levels and there are also concerns with parebens
in childrens bathing products etc causing premature breast growth as well as pubic hair growth in as young

i have this iron in three sizes. i have the 1", the 1.25" and the 2". this size is by far my most used size. i have mid back length hair and it's medium thickness. it is wavy by nature but i typically curl it after blow drying it straight. this iron has been my go to after years of use, and it still looks as good as the day i bought it-8 years ago. it's in pristine condition and it works like a charm, and it gets used.

there are adjustable settings for the temperature on here-it's a dial-set it once and then leave it alone. not like electronic ones where you have to reset it every time you use it. i do wish this had an auto off feature, that's my one thing i want that newer irons have. the barrel on here is the perfect size for most hair types. it gives the loose barrel curl type, the "victoria's secret curl" a lot of girls are after. the longer you hold the curl, the better longevity you will get. i have experimented with this thing for years and gotten tons of variety with it.

there is a longer barrel version of this floating out there now for women with really long hair, and i feel like while that might be useful, it might be harder to manhandle as well. this works well for me even when my hair has been exceptionally long. i think that had i known to buy this on amazon back in college, i could have saved some money. the clamp is really strong, and while the iron comes with a replacement spring, i have not needed to replace mine in almost a decade of ownership with heavy usage.

i love hot tools.  they are affordable and heat up fact and get hot.  i now own a 1 3/4 in, a 1 inch and a 3/4 inch.  1 is ceramic, 2 are gold.  i know that hairstylists use the gold, but i prefer the ceramic and wish i would have bought this in ceramic.  for me, i find the hair tends to stick to the gold making it hard to seemlessly curl the hair.

once the unit cools, i wipe off the rod and clamp to get rid of hair products that could build-up and interfere with performance.

4545,"this curling iron really works on my hard-to-curl shoulder-length hair. the drugstore model i had bought does not. perhaps it's because this one can get so hot (adjustable temp)and/or the metal it's made with (it's heavier than the one from the drug store) seems to be higher quality. and it does not damage or singe my hair. it works so well, the larger 1 1/2" version may have done the job, don't know...will stay with this one. perhaps the slightly smaller, but still fairly large, barrel makes it so i don't have to hold it as long, maybe requiring less heat? the only thing i wish were different is that it does not have an automatic shut-off, and i keep leaving it on by accident--which would be a problem with young children in the house. am wondering if the spare springs are needed because others do the same? anyway, this curling iron has dramatically improved the look of my fine hair. i use it to add body at the ends, not for curly curls, but am sure it would also work well for curlier styles.

update: it's almost four years since i wrote the review, and the curling iron is still going strong! i carry the extra spring in my suitcase, and haven't needed it as of yet. oh, and my husband got me an auto shutoff device that i plug into an outlet, and the curling iron into this widget, and so now i have auto shutoff!

4547,"first, i meant to order the 1" curling iron so i'm going to give you the approximate circumference of the 3/4" one which is 2 7/8".  when i hold the measuring tape up next to the barrel it measures 3/4".  my hairdresser cut my layers a tad too short last time so my mistake worked in my favor. i'd be burning myself quite often if i was using the 1" size.

i have a 1" hot tool curing iron, just like this one, that i've been using for over 6 years. my husband replaced the plug once because i had to keep wiggling the cord & plug to get everything in the proper place for the curling iron to stay on. recently i began having problems with the cord again, but this time it's where the cord attaches to the handle & that is why i was ordering another curling iron. this new design is supposed to prevent that problem...only time will tell. i will update my review if necessary.

these irons come with two extra springs...i didn't have to use the extra springs with my old one, but i'm very happy the extras are included. (we've had to replace the springs in other curling irons i've owned through the years. it was never easy to find a replacement spring). the temperature settings/numbers eventually wore off of my old one & i'm expecting this one to do the same because they're applied in the same manner. i have a favorite setting.  i marked my old one with a silver permanent marker so i'd know which setting to use. although these curling irons get very, very hot i do not & will not use the higher settings. for goodness sakes, my hair isn't made from asbestos. fyi: my hairdresser recently burned a section of my hair off when her curling iron was set too hot. thankfully, it was in a hidden spot, i don't have long layers, and i was able to cover the burned off hair until it grew back. anyway, let that be a warning to you...it can happen. i've used curling irons for years & years & years & that was a first for me & my hairdresser.  i use the #7 temperature. it's the first setting on the 'extra hot' category. my baby fine hair is extremely hard to curl. if this curling iron lives up to its predecessor, i can expect many more useful years out of it.  and, soon, i will be placing an order for the 1" size.

4552,"my wife doesn't usually wear foundation as we live in the humid south. however, the la roche-posay toleriane teint hydrating liquid foundation goes on light and feels soothing and cooling to the skin. this is not a heavy foundation, but a light cover up that helps even out skin tones. my wife loves how natural it looks and feels.

a small amount blends nicely without feeling as though it's clogging up pores and it stands up to warmer sub-tropic temps and humidity without melting off her face. she primarily uses it as a spot foundation especially on dry patches. the foundation feels nourishing and does not irritate her skin. overall, this is a quality foundation that feels good and stands up to florida conditions.

i was super lucky in that this actually did match my skin.  i have been using it for about a month now and i really like it.  i normally wear a lancome liquid foundation and i have found that this one is a bit thicker and seems to stay on a bit longer.

my only other qualm with this makeup is that the way the bottle is designed - a tiny squeeze and you have enough foundation for 3 days.  i wish they would rethink the bottle a bit.  i do like that it's a squeeze bottle, however i wish the opening were a bit smaller so that i could get the exact amount i want out of it.

not sure how long this small and definitely premium-cost container will last, especially as i haven't yet gotten the hang of squirting just enough so im probably using more foundation than needed. and then theres excess creeping out, but that may be worth it to some people. all in all, i thought this was a good, premium foundation.",2018-05-03,5,5,A39H1GO9E3YQIB,B00B95PWFS

this has wonderful coverage - it looks as though you've used a primer underneath.

it also goes on easily, blends in without creating lines, and stays on. (i use a foundation brush, which i believe works better than anything else).

my only complaint is that it is hard to tell which color to get by just looking at the photos. my skin color is fair and cool, but i usually go slightly darker to avoid looking like a ghost. i got the sand color which is unfortunately a bit too dark and warm-toned for my just-emerging-from-winter skin color. i am pretty sure the color will work in the summertime when my skin gets darker anyway, but for now i feel i erred with the color. i wish there was a better description of the colors or underlying tones.

two others that i like quite a lot and can compare this to are clinique's even better glow and lumene's instant glow beauty serum.
lumene's is thinner consistency and sheerer than this, which is more like the clinique product. the sand color is similar to clinique's" honey", if that helps anyone.",2018-04-23,5,5,A2ZGPAIV64KOYU,B00B95PWFS
4580,"if the color had been a better match for me, it would have been almost perfect. its possible that, as i get a little darker in the summer, it might be a better match. right now, i had to remove some of it (using a slightly moist cotton pad) because it was a poor match for my skin color. the light beige color, which sounds like it should be a good match for me is ok in intensity but leans towards a light-colored band aid color that has too much tint for my skin. objectively speaking, i have more yellow in my skin and this shade has more brownish-pink.

it is easy to apply. it goes on smoothly without leaving tracks or demarcation lines. the more you smooth it on, the better it absorbs. i like the way it evens out skin color. i have tiny little red veins that make me look as if im overdoing the blush powder and this crme covers it up without a painted-on look (even though it is less yellow than it should be). it also fills the pores just enough for smoothness and without looking artificial. i have very dry skin, but it feels light when wearing it and is easy to remove at the end of the day. even though i was at an outdoor event that started during a warm late afternoon and went on to around 11 in the evening, the coverage was undisturbed by sweating or the passage of time. photographs taken (with a lens that is very unforgiving) looked natural and did not reflect flash spots. many friends commented on how good and relaxed i looked and asked if i had lost weight. go figure!

the one star that i took off a perfect rating was not for the color mis-match. it is because it is only a finish. granted, it is a good finisha little face powder and maybe blush and you're at your absolute best. but it doesnt contain spf protection (a must in florida) or a moisturizer (although, frankly, it feels soft as if it doesmaybe its the hyaluronic acid?). you must first lay a foundation of those basic products and then add this as the final touchtoo many steps for everyday use. this makes it somewhat less practical and more labor intensive than an all-in-one product. its something i will use for special occasions when i want to look really good for a really long time.",2018-04-23,4,5,A2VWE5SGNDS8HW,B00B95PWFS

i think i have found "the one".

i have been using some pretty nice cover foundations, but they all can make me pasty, and my pores enlarged; not always, but at times, which is strange.  i now have products i can mix with those makeups to make me look more radiant, but i like this hydrating liquid makeup more.  i have dry skin, and my tired 63-year-old skin with sunspots needs perking up, and toning down all at once.  i had the most amazing day, trying this on with some other products, and together, i really loved the look.  i will always say yes to looking younger, and not sallow.  at my age this is a real treat.  i'm not one to try new products on my own, due to my never having found adequate foundations.  i've had better luck more recently with another great brand, and i have tried this brand before, with their moisturizers, and such, so this is a good experience all around.  my dermatologist recommends this brand: la roche-posay.

i have zero doubts about this one, which is the perfect shade for me.  i suppose it would be nice if it was a bigger tube of course, but what i am getting here is more precious.  youth at my age.  creamy liquid foundation that makes me glow.

well, this is not hydrating.  it actually sticks to my dry skin and makes it look dull and shows every line and crease. it's very chalky and lays on top of the skin horribly.  not a fan.  i do use a lot of laroche products and love the fact that they do not irritate my sensitive skin and usually work perfectly for me, but this is not a winner.",2018-04-17,2,1,A2OQYSTYR8SSVQ,B00B95PWFS

4598,"i really like this liquid foundation. it goes on well, it feels nice on my face, it smooths evenly, i think it looks good.
i didn't break out after using it either, as is often the case with new makeup.

the only problem i had with this is figuring out what color im supposed to get. i typically get the 2nd-to-lightest color in a foundation spectrum. this one, sand, is a 3, but im not sure if that is 3rd lightest or 3rd darkest. (their 1 is ivory so maybe 3rd lightest? but then their 5 looks lighter than the sand but then the large color swatches all look the same to me)
the color of the container is much lighter than the actual liquid, which is more like yeah, sand. however, it looks darker when it comes out, its a bit lighter than that when you actually put it on. it works for me, as long as i blend into my hairline and my neck well, but i would have been better off with a lighter shade.",2018-04-17,4,3,A3GFK7F5IUF60X,B00B95PWFS

my biggest concerns are dark spots, so i need something that provides an even finish. this does so. it is not too heavy either. the color blended well into my medium-light complexion. a little goes a long way. the one drawback is that this does not last as long throughout the day. i needed to reapply about 6 hours later. it just needed a touch up. otherwise i really like this foundation.",2018-04-17,4,5,A3M3W5GV0HIQK4,B00B95PWFS

i originally was not crazy about this formula, but after using it several days, i like it. it is pretty full coverage, and it sits well and doesnt seem to oxidize. it does come off easily to the touch, but overall, i like this for a more full coverage look than their b.b. cream.

original review:

i have been using this brands bb creams for years. while i love those, although they could cover a little better, im not a big fan of this one. it goes on more difficulty than the bb cream, and i have to use more product too. this foundation also clings to any dry skin illuminating it.

i kept the foundation on for an hour or so and looked at my face. surprisingly, it seemed to have settled nicely. my dry skin was no longer obvious, and it left me with a nice smooth finish. overall, this is just okay. it may just be my skin, but i prefer the b.b. cream.",2018-04-16,4,3,A1NQK5MH9GTJ6S,B00B95PWFS
4604,"i don't wear make-up very often so i am certainly no expert.  when i do apply foundation i always think of my first grade teacher (a lovely woman) who wore a light make-up which stopped at her chin-line. her neck was several shades darker. i digress.

i applied a moisturizer then the foundation. i was amazed at how smoothly the foundation went on. it dried quickly and didn't wipe off.  i received the sand color and it blended very well with my skin tone with no demarcation line. it only takes a tiny bit for coverage. the foundation was weightless and i forgot i was wearing it until someone mentioned how nice my skin looked. she didn't know i was wearing foundation.

this has totally changed my opinion of what foundation can be. i don't really have dark circles or anything that needs a concealer but i like the smooth, even look of the foundation and think i will be using it more often.",2018-04-16,5,5,A2G04D4QZAXL15,B00B95PWFS
4605,"this foundation is supposed to be hydrating and smooth. with just a few colors available it was hard to tell which color would work best for me and i could not find shade swatches anywhere, and amazon pics only show one shade in all the different pics, so i ordered the sand-sable color available to me, but when it arrived it is not a perfect match. however, the next shade up seemed too dark.

i use several liquid foundations in the same price range and i am not very impressed with this one. my favorites in this price range are mac studio fix fluid and mac waterweight, in shade nc30 or nc35 in summer. they are more full coverage vs. this foundation. waterweight is very spreadable and more comparable to this one but i still think it gives better coverage as it hides my redness better than the la roche-posay. i also like clinique foundations, i use clinique even better glow foundation in nuetral or honey shade that has slight luminiscence and lighter coverage than this foundation but better spreadability. clinique superbalanced silk in my shade vanilla is probably the closest with moderate coverage and easy spreadability, but it blends more easily than this foundation.

4613,"i hadn't tried la roche-posay makeup products so i took a chance this in golden beige not knowing if it would be my exact shade but at least in pictures it reminded me of jouer matte moisture tint in nude so i decided to take a chance.

when applying it, i've been using the same method as i always use with my foundations or tinted moisturizers applying it first to my face with my fingers and then blending out with my beauty blender.  when applying it to my skin i noticed that it felt creamy and the texture seemed to be aptly described by 'mousse.'  unfortunately, this is too dark for my skin and not a match.  and even if it was the matte finish is less than flattering with my skin.  i tend to apply a thin layer of foundation and build from there only when necessary, preferring concealer to correct for blemishes.  even using just a minimal amount of product this accentuated the fine lines in my forehead and around my eyes.  i think it could be a better choice for someone who has very oily skin, but with my skin that is somewhere between normal and dry it wasn't flattering.

i'd recommend trying a sample or tester out first if you can to ensure you have the right color and using this if your skin is oily or fine line free.",2017-07-04,3,2,AHN86VFJIJ2JP,B00B95PWYE

i was so skeptical given the track record that i had with trying alternative brands, which often failed to live up to my standards of a good foundation. needless to say i was in utter shock how much i liked this product. finding the right color tone and consistency is also a problem for me. i was worried that this would either be too light or too dark, but it was spot on for my fair complexion (although sun kissed skin in the summer may change this slightly). don't let the initial thin constancy fool you, either. this stuff provides full coverage and conceals minor imperfections. i didn't even have to blend any foundation lines at my jawline. it really give my complexion a beautiful, smooth look. i think i've finally found my backup foundation. who knows maybe i'll even change brands permanently at this point. either way, i am very pleased with this...it's a keeper!",2018-04-13,5,5,AZQKNX6F8S84Q,B00B95PWFS
4615,"this la roche-posay toleriane teint hydrating liquid foundation makeup water cream with hyaluronic acid says it is designed for normal to dry, sensitive skin but so far, it's wonderful on my somewhat oily skin (although it's not the heat of summer yet.)

oddly, it doesn't make my somewhat oily skin turn into an oil slick on my face! it seems to be fine, even after wearing all day. perhaps when the summer heat hits texas, i will have a problem with oil but so far, it's very good.

no scent
non-irritating
feels good on the skin
no breakouts
went on smoothly

cons:
a little drying in non-oily areas like my cheeks
caked and flaked a bit a couple of hours after application

4625,"i'm very fair and have a lot of redness on my face, and this foundation managed to cover up the redness and not look too obvious. i'd probably prefer one shade lighter if that were an option just because in the bright light, ivory can still appear a little unnaturally dark. it looks perfectly fine in normal indoor-lighting, however.

the texture is similar to cake icing or mousse, so it feels very soft and spreads easily. it is also extremely pigmented, so it's easy to use too much and get a "cakey" texture - after the first or second time applying, you learn really quickly that you only need a little bit. this is a huge plus to me.

i experimented with using my fingers to apply it, and a foundation brush, and a make-up sponge. the brush was ok, but i felt like a lot of the foundation got caught in the hairs. the sponge had the best results, in my opinion, and i felt my face looked more even in tone than if i used my fingers. my t-zone tends to get oily throughout the day, but my face didn't look shiny at all if i applied this foundation just once in the morning (and made sure not to touch my face, rubbing the foundation off); it stayed matte all day.

i have to think this isn't a good foundation if you're pretty oily all-over, because while the foundation feels very light, it's very thick and may feel uncomfortable. aside from my t-zone, my skin is pretty normal (sometimes even dry in summer from overusing the a/c) and the foundation felt fine to me. i can see this would probably be a pretty good choice for normal, dry, and/or sensitive skin.

4627,"i am actually quite surprised how much i like this foundation. i have used la roche-posay effaclar bb cream and the rosaliac cc cream, and both quickly found their way to the back of my makeup drawer. so, i had somewhat low expectations when i decided to give this a try. i love la roche-posay skincare, and figured they had better just stick with skincare, until i tried this foundation. for reference, i have oily, mildly acne-prone skin, and am 32. i am nc20-25 in mac.

first of all, i actually received the lightest shade, ivory 01--when i thought i'd be receiving the next shade darker, light beige 02. i'm only mentioning this because it turns out i am glad i received the lightest shade. it is perfect. i would think very fair people would have difficulty finding a "fair enough" shade, because i am a light-medium skinned with warm undertones.

toleriane mattifying mousse is truly mousse-like upon application..it's strange how it feels so light when i squeeze it out of the tube, yet actually can pack a decent amount of coverage. i wouldn't call this high coverage by any means, but it is more pigmented than you would think based on the light texture. it spreads out nicely and evens out my skin very well. it is buildable, so you can add a little here or there as needed. i would consider it medium coverage. it also has a very smooth, silicone feel to it..verrry silicone-y. i was worried it would just sit on top of my skin because of how it felt, but i completely forgot that i had it on and didn't notice vast amounts of foundation coming off on tissues or a napkin. it's not bulletproof but does have better staying power than expected. oh, and it is truly unscented. after trying the rosaliac cc cream (whoa, it was perfumey!), i was dubious about this. i am not sensitive to scents and don't mind the typical la roche-posay scent in so many of their products--but you will not find it here.",2017-05-12,5,5,A3HZ687GB0AH7Y,B00B95PWYE

4639,"this review is for the 05 dark beige color of the la roche-posay toleriane teint mattifying mousse matte foundation for oily skin and sensitive skin.

disclaimer:  this review was written by my wife!

we ordered "honey beige" and received "05 hl&eacute; - dark beige", which is not one of the colors offered on the product page. hl&eacute; means sunburned or tanned, and it is for darker skin, not for the darkest skin tones.  its too dark for me, as i usually use the second lightest color for foundations.

pros
the foundation is not fragrant like some of their products
does not irritate my skin at all
does not give a cakey look
covers pores and uneven skin colors well
looks beautiful right after the application

cons
in less than a couple of hours, my skin, especially forehead area, looks almost exactly like the texture of "saffiano printed calf skin", with numerous fine straight-line wrinkles going both vertically and horizontally. i could not believe that, so i tried the foundation with and without moisturizers and foundation bases, but my forehead still ended up in looking like the material with which my purse is made. i don't even have visible wrinkles on my forehead without the foundation, so it ended up making my skin look far worse, rather than better.

4642,"la roche-posay toleriane teint mattifying mousse matte foundation for oily skin and sensitive skin. this matte foundation makeup for sensitive skin is presented by laroche-posay, a french firm with a long, honored presence in womens cosmetics that is recommended by 25,000 dermatologists worldwide.  the firm states that it offers a unique daily skincare line developed using a strict formulation charter, stringent clinical testing for efficacy, safety, even on sensitive skin. this foundation is said to be a large pore minimizer; it claims to  cover blemishes, absorb oil for matte even skin tone. the firm recommends it for daily coverage; states that it is suitable for oily skin, sensitive skin, will visibly cover skin imperfections blur pores, instantly absorb oil. la roche adds that the cosmetic contains cutting-edge smoothing mattifier airlicium that will absorb oil for all-day matte skin.  it is, furthermore, fragrance-free, paraben-free, oil-free, non-comedogenic.  ingredients: dimethicone, undecane, dimethicone crosspolymer, tridecane, tocopheryl acetate, silica silylate, perlite, disodium stearoyl glutamate, retinyl linoleate, aluminum hydroxide, may contain titanium dioxide, iron oxides. it comes in five different shades: ivory, light beige, sand, golden beige, honey beige.

well, amazon vine sent this foundation to me in a shade, 04 honey beige,  that is too dark for my skin, doesnt look good on me.  they can, of course, hardly be expected to know my skin tone.  the foundation does serve to minimize pores. but: this foundation turns a distinct orange color on my face, and, aside from the current american president, few people want orange skin. perhaps a more suitable shade might not do this; ive no way of knowing.  meanwhile, i agree with other reviewers that youve only got to look at the foundation cross-eyed to get blank spots, holidays, my dad used to call them.  and its a bit tricky to fill them in.",2017-04-13,2,5,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B00B95PWYE

at $30, it is not cheap, but a small amount goes a long way and the product is very comfortable to wear and gives nice coverage. when my current foundation runs out, i will be tempted to try this again, in a lighter shade.",2017-04-12,5,4,A3EBJDZ5N1UEI5,B00B95PWYE
4644,"my wifes review since she is the one using it:  this is my first experience with a la roche mousse matte foundation product. i have oily, yet sensitive skin. i have periodic problems with adult acne thats often difficult to cover. amoxicillin is helping a lot recently.

when i applied the la roche foundation on my skin, it felt very light  not exactly like it was a foundation. it mostly covered my acne problems, which were not at all good at the time and i only applied a small amount of it.  the product is like a paste  not a liquid  unlike any other foundation i have tried. and ive tried a lot of them. however, im not entirely fond of how it goes on and feels afterwards.  its difficult to describe.  somehow, it doesnt quite feel like it adheres to my skin very well, kind of cakey.  i think you can see it in my photos.  ignore the color difference of my skin and this product shade.

from the description, i thought this foundation would work well for me.  i am from the philippines, but i have comparatively light complexion skin  but not entirely white, either.  the sample i received (ivory) is too light color for my skin  didn't get a choice of shade via amazon vine plus it was difficult to know in advance what the exact shade would be until i tried it.  i wish i could have chosen the honey beige version, which is probably more like the natural color of my skin.

i still wanted to try it to determine if it was suitable for me. very recently, i received the roche posay effaclar purifying foaming gel cleanser and i like it a lot  especially since i have oily and sensitive skin.

ive considered buying a different shade of this foundation, but its a bit expensive. also, the antibiotics and prescription nighttime creams my new dermatologist prescribed have virtually cleared my skin of acne, to the point i stopped wearing any makeup at all as of today.  even though this foundation supplied to me via amazon vine, the value is reported as income to the irs  self-employment taxes of 15.3% plus income tax on the product value. i just finished my taxes and its about 30% overall, obviously better than retail, of course.",2017-04-12,3,2,A2AF0NOCM71J0B,B00B95PWYE

4649,"with "mousse" in the product name, i was expecting something with a really light and soft texture perhaps like freshly whipped cream.  mousse is an accurate description but it is more like the stiff texture of chocolate mousse that has sat in the bowl awhile.  lots of air bubbles when you squeeze it out.  i mashed it around with my finger to get the texture more even to put on my face.

i dabbed it in little spots across my face and then smoothed it across my skin with a sponge that is target's version of a beauty blender.  i have also spread it across my face with my fingers though that doesn't give me as even a coverage as the sponge.  i prefer a sheer coverage so i spread it fairly thin.  it does give a matte finish  for actual foundation is is pretty much ok.  i think one could put it on much thicker than i did and it would give fuller coverage.  the product itself is a little thicker than i am used to so i don't know how it would apply with a makeup brush.

during the winter i don't like to look too dry so i stay away from the matte look.  i think this will work better for me in the summer when i want to avoid looking too shiny.",2017-04-02,3,3,A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N,B00B95PWYE

4659,"in general, our household tends to avoid expensive makeup.  i know quality often comes at a price, but usually average priced makeup products suit our needs.  while this foundation is pricey (to me) at $30 for 1.65 ounces, it does go a long way.  it also is spf 20 while containing no preservatives nor fragrance.

the maker lists it as "fragrance-free, paraben-free, oil-free, non-comedogenic ingredients: dimethicone, undecane, dimethicone crosspolymer, tridecane, tocopheryl acetate, silica silylate, perlite, disodium stearoyl glutamate, retinyl linoleate, aluminum hydroxide, may contain titanium dioxide, iron oxides.

it comes in 5 shades:
01 ivory
02 light beige
03 sand
04 golden beige
05 honey beige

the light beige goes on evenly on fair skin and provides spf 20 sun protection, and does not looking unnatural.  you need to apply very little, a dab the size of a gumball dotted among your cheeks, nose, neck and forehead can be blended in to cover your face evenly.

the foundation looks very natural and blends easily and evenly.  it does a nice job covering blemishes and evening complexion while not looking or feeling heavy, or making you feel like your pores are clogged.

4688,"i got this foundation through the amazon vine program to review.  the vine program accidentally sent me tint 01 (which is too light for me) instead of the listed tint 02 they said they were going to send.  because of this i am having a bit of a hard time telling if this foundation looks powdery on me because of the light color or the consistency of the product.

anyway, i have very sensitive skin and there are very few foundations i can use without breaking out (i love flower's erase everything foundation which is pretty much the only other foundation i've used that doesn't break me out).  this foundation was great in that it doesn't break me out at all!  it's also very easy to apply.  my only complaint would be staying power; it rubs off pretty easily. i have fairly greasy skin, so i curious to how it will hold up in the summer in high humidity but we will have to see.

overall i would recommend this as a great foundation for those with sensitive skin and i plan on buying another tube in a darker color.  see my pros and cons below for more details.  there is no spf in this so i would recommend applying over a sunscreen lotion in the summer. i use (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/eltamd-uv-physical-broad-spectrum-spf-41/dp/b0012xo2w6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8">eltamd uv physical broad-spectrum spf 41</a>&nbsp;which is the only facial sunscreen i have found so far that doesn't cause breakouts for me.

pros:
- goes on easy and blends out nicely (never looks patchy)
- provides good medium to high coverage
- feels great on skin; feels nice and light and gives your skin a silky soft feeling
- doesn't cause breakouts on my super sensitive skin
- stays matte over the whole day

cons:
- product is a bit stiff coming out of container i have to be careful it doesn't fall off my finger onto the floor
- the color i got (01) looks a bit powdery on me; you see it sitting on my skin when i am in sun...i am not sure if this is just the color i got or if it is product consistency
- foundation rubs off fairly easily especially around nose and mouth.

4689,"reviewed by my wife:
i'm shocked. stunned. i had given up on finding a foundation that i could wear without stinging and irritation - but as a vine reviewer, this product was offered at no cost in exchange for my honest review, so i thought, what do i have to lose?

so glad i did....yay!!!! i love this!

first, it is very thick, and i thought it would go on heavy or cakey. neither was the case. it spreads very evenly and nicely, takes very little to give the right touch to the whole face and neck. it smoothed to a silky finish that had me saying to my daughter, "feel this!" the coverage was excellent, without dimming the glow of natural complexion.  that has always a disappointment to me in other foundations, as i find that they make one look sort of dead, and more like a natural fiber canvas than a living being. again, this was not my experience with this product. it evened out my skin tone and softened the lines and wrinkles, it gave a nice "glow" and felt wonderful.

as mentioned above, i have sensitive skin, and most liquid makeup and moisturizers make my skin sting, almost immediately, and without stop for hours until i wash it off. even the stuff specially formulated for sensitive skin has not worked for me -- until this. not only doesn't it irritate my skin, but i loved the look all day long - and even forgot to remove it when i went to bed. that's how wonderful it is.

the $30 price tag might seem a little much compared to drug store brands, but with the superior nature of the product, it's very much worth it to me. beyond that, it takes so little to give full coverage by comparison to common store brands that i don't think you'll actually spend more on this.

to sum up: if i could give this 10 stars, i would. highly recommended.",2017-03-04,5,5,A265IEMG2K5R4W,B00B95PWYE

4692,"la roche-posay mattifying mousse foundation is much smoother, and much more moist than i expected it to be.  the consistency is very pleasing, and i can really see that my skin looks better with it on, versus the telltale chalky texture of matte finishes i have felt, or "too-thin and oily" texture of most non-matte foundations i have used. i needed only apply a few drops to see some coverage.

the color is a tad bit darker than i expected; however, i find that pleasing.  this is for oily to sensitive skin, and i do not see that it contains oil. this shade is #4, golden beige. it feels refreshing to have actual cover from a foundation without my having to put a lot on.  i have sun and age spots, and i am very aware of them.  when i have this fine foundation on i see that my skin glows.

my skin actually has a bit of a pasty look naturally, due to my not being able to tolerate the sun; thus i do not go out in it at all if i can help it.  a dermatologist has told me that even inside the house i can get sun spots.  i use a 30 spf moisturizer underneath to guard against that.  i find that this makeup stays in place, and it doesn't over or under cover my face.

i think it is pricey, but it is the best foundation i have ever used.  i have always thought lancome to be a desirable brand of makeup, yet this has so many qualities that surpass it.  i've been using l'oreal visible lift, and i find it doesn't do anything visible for my appearance.

i have light/natural skin with a yellow undertone.  i've attached a picture to show you that the "04" is for beige dark/golden beige skin.  also, worth mentioning that i have sensitive prone skin and this is one of the few foundations that cause zero irritation.  so far, all the laroche products that i've tried, i have not had any reaction to.  huge plus.

i ended up getting the 02 beige clair/light beige and i absolutely love it.  definitely give this a try.  really easy to apply, blends beautifully, doesn't cake, and lasts throughout the day.

it's a mousse that you squeeze from a tube, so it's not drippy.  it has a whipped air texture that glides over the skin. it's not heavy or thick at all, but it makes my skin look perfect. i've been using it for about a week now and really can't get over how good my skin looks.

as for the shade, ivory is darker than i expected.  i have pale skin, but i never wear ivory (typically, the lightest shade in a range).  i'm usually a few shades darker. however, in this brand it's just right.  there is no pink in it. it has more yellow-neutral undertones.

4707,"i just bought this from a store a week ago.  the sales people swore by it and said i would love it. here are my initial impressions:

cons:  improvement is not immediately obvious.  it is quite a time consuming routine - more like 20 mins than the advertised 5 mins.  you have to use it everyday.  the gel dries too quickly.  very expensive gadget for what it is.  there are other attachments you can buy for about $150 each.  just too expensive all around.

pros:  simple to use.  the device fits well in the hand. portable.  rechargeable.  the charge lasts a long time --- weeks.  i had occasion to call nuface customer service, and they were very nice and helpful. you get to speak with a human.

notes:  forget spending money on gel.  the salesman told me that i can use plain water without the gel.  i use just water and it works -- no need for any gel.

update:  i have been using this daily for about 10 months... i don't think my face looks different but feels different -- maybe harder/firmer? if i stop using it for just a few days, i lose that hard feeling.  still takes about 20 mins to do the routine. kind of time consuming, but you can do it while watching tv, reading etc..

so far, nobody has told me they notice anything different.  i look in the mirror and don't see any difference.... so, i don't think i would tell anyone to go out and buy this $$$ gadget..... i continue to use it but i don't hold out hope for any great improvement.

i recently started using roc lift serum (drugstore product) and saw actual results in a week.  i thought i was dreaming.

the good here is that while i can't say that i see any huge difference with my facial contours, i have seen a noticeable difference with my breakouts. this seems to have done a number on my splotches, enough to where i'm pretty impressed. it didn't completely get rid of them, but the spots are lighter than they would on their own. it's enough that if the con of this wasn't so noticeable, i would absolutely be converted.

the con here is that this gave me headaches. this may have been because i was using it at half strength for most of the time, but i've noticed it when i was using it at the lowest setting. the headaches aren't splitting, but they're there and unfortunately my headaches like to linger. i'm trying to debate if i want to continue despite this and limit the usage to only once or twice a week and do only half the routine. i really do like the zit zapping effect. i'm just unfortunately now one of those people who are a little prone to getting lingering headaches, so this likely won't be a problem for heartier people.

now i'm sure that a big question people will have is "does it hurt?" while i could occasionally feel the electricity at half power, it wasn't unpleasant at all and as long as the gel is still dry, is are you won't feel much of anything. it's more of a tingling feeling than anything else when you do feel it, but i imagine that it will be more noticeable at full blast. i've never had it on full blast since i didn't think it was necessary.

so the question here is whether or not it's worth it, as this is an expensive item. assuming that my results with acne are standard, it's definitely something to look at it you have acne that likes to stick around like i do. i'm not sure how hygienic it is to share these, otherwise i'd suggest using a friend's first to see what you think. as far as wrinkles go, i can't say much on that since mine are fairly small, but i will try to persevere through the headaches with a less frequent schedule and update.",2017-11-21,4,4,A2XNOB1T796Y6B,B00BJ5XCBE

4721,"i have used this item for several weeks now. i do see alittle difference as i had some sagging more so on one side of my face than the other. now the one side seems to be more in line with the other side. the item will run down even if its charged fully meaning if you charge it and unplug it and its still turned off it will run down. also, the gel you have to use with it is expensive for the small amount you receive. the item itself i found to be way over priced for the general improvement. this item is okay, its not a miracle as they advertise but it is making a small difference. i believe it will also stimulate hair growth as i have noticed more hair on my face and its thicker and more course. be ready to use this 5 days a week and it takes 20 minutes for a full session. the gel has to be washed off afterwards.",2015-09-01,3,3,A1C8J8N4BKDFN3,B00BJ5XCBE
4722,"first let's look at the trinity device itself and then we'll get into the eye and lip enhancer attachment. the nuface trinity makes a big promise: use and you will see your skin plump and firm to reduce the signs of aging. does it work? yes. is it the easiest or most convenient product ever invented? no. read on.

process: after washing your face, you will apply the gel primer to the areas you want to target. because the gel dries very fast i break up my face into three treatment areas: forehead/brows, left side of face, right side of face. following the 'beep' of the device, you glide the nuface over the area three times. there are many techniques you can use to do this. for example, your cheek/side of face is divided into three sections: along the jaw, in the hollows of your cheeks, and on your cheek bone. you glide over each area three times, slowly, in tune to the beep of the device. you can also use a hold technique where you leave the device in one place for the beep cycle. this is particularly effective on your nasolabial folds and for picking up your eyebrows. when you are finished you will wash the gel primer off with a warm wash-cloth. you can then apply moisturizer and either makeup (if using in am) or night creams (if using in pm).

results: you will see results instantly. i notice them most in my smile lines and in my brows/the 'elevens' between my eyes. let me explain. the effect is two-fold. the lines are plumped so you no longer see the smile lines or the 'elevens'. there is also a slight paralysis effect in that you can smile and the lines don't come back. very neat. i hate my down-turned brows. i have taught myself to constantly hold them up using my forehead muscles. the nuface creates the same result i get when holding my brows up. my brows easily stay up about a centimeter from where they would be in resting position. this makes me look more awake and less grumpy- definitely a plus!

drawbacks:
-the biggest drawback is that the results are temporary. after about 6 hours your face is back to normal. therefore if you want the results, you'll need to use everyday day and night which brings me to the second drawback...
-time is a big issue. for a full treatment with optimal results, you need about 20-30 minutes. i find if i do a "quickie" the results aren't near as noticeable and fade quickly. if you have the time to spend an hour a day on your face, you'll have no issues. for those of us who need every minute of every day for work/life... it gets old even though the results are great. it's still a great investment for those nights out when you want to look fabulous. i actually first heard about the product in an elle magazine article about stylists and makeup artists who used it to prep celebrities before an award show so they would look younger and refreshed.
-i hate how the gel primer feels. it's similar to smearing your face with syrup or jelly. i just do not like the sensation. then it is thick so you have to work it off with the washcloth.

ele (eye and lip enhancer) attachment: i should state that i do not have smoker's lines on my lips and i do not yet have crow's feet. perhaps if i had these types of lines i would have gotten more out of the ele. that said, i do have awful tear trough lines and smile lines. i honestly did not notice a big difference when using the ele attachment to target these areas and using the regular nuface. i experienced the same amount of lift and plump without having to switch out the device heads. some of the youtube tutorials i watched recommended using the ele to really target your brows and i have to say i get much better lift using the original device on my brows than the ele! based on my experience, you really don't need the ele unless perhaps you have smoker's lines or crow's feet.",2015-08-30,4,3,A1E3TWWRB1Q7CS,B00BJ5XCBE
4723,"i'm reviewing this "early" (i.e., the company recommends using this for 60 days and i've been using it for 30), however the deadline for this review was half-way through the recommended period over which you would see dramatic results.  i'm not a spa person, so the little shocks were a bit off-putting, though as i've improved my technique, i don't go past my hairline as much and have minimized shocks.  if you are sensitive to pain, this may not be the treatment for you. it's not a big, bad shock, just a little zap which can be unsettling if you're  not prepared for it.

the good:  lots of great videos to help the neophyte learn how to use this tool.  also, it's a great size, not clunky & fits very ergonomically into your hand.

the bad: i'm a busy person & don't see this as a permanent fixture in my routine.  they have a video where a woman is using the device while ushering children off to school  i'm not a multi-tasker.  i'm also uncoordinated.so i prefer to be in front of a mirror when using this, even after four weeks.  also, you will be spending money for the face lubricant every few months, so add that to the list of considerations when contemplating purchasing this product.  (disclaimer- i don't know how much this process is worth in spa dollars, so you may come out ahead!)

the upshot - it's a well-designed machine.  i didn't see a great deal of difference, but the ritual itself is very soothing.  i say, if this is your thing, then it's probably worth the price.",2015-08-29,3,4,A19Z4IDNL1MGG4,B00BJ5XCBE
4724,"this is a very complete and well packaged kit that requires a long term commitment to achieve subtle results.  very sturdy and well made.  whether or not these subtle changes are worth the effort is an individual conclusion. theres also not a lot known about the risks associated with sending electrical impulses into your face.  the process is fairly easy and for me, pain free.  spas provide this sort of treatment, thus it is convenient to have such a device at home.  i suggest you watch the various videos online before use.  it certainly works, though its debatable if its worth over $400.",2015-08-29,4,5,A3A5XNAM3ZW7Z6,B00BJ5XCBE
4725,"the nuface trinity is not a small investment, but if you can replace face lifts than this could make sense for you. we felt like it did work although depending on your age and skin condition, you may see more of a difference than i did.

the nuface is packaged nicely and it has very clear instructions (including a video tutorial). my husband and i both have been using this. once charged, we were able to get going with it in no time. we followed the instructions as well as possible. to be honest, the idea zapping my face with electric current freaks me out a little bit (even though the practice has become very common) so i wanted to be as careful as possible. the device has 5 different strength levels. on level one, neither of us felt much. on level three, you do feel something if you go outside the area you spread the priming gel so it's important to spread the gel on all of the areas of your face that you'll be using the nuface on.

my husband and i have fairly youthful skin, however after using this we did feel like we saw a lift. based on my testing, i think the condition of your skin will have a big difference on how immediate and how noticeable the results are. the instructions suggest you use this 5 days a week for 60 days, and after that 3 days a week. this seems quite often which i'm not so sure about. we haven't encountered any reactions or adverse effects yet (and my husband has extremely sensitive skin), so that's good.

overall, this isn't cheap. if you have never had a microcurrent facial treatment and are not sure if it will work for you, you may want to consider trying a treatment once or twice in a salon and if you see the benefits, you can easily replace the salon with the nuface as over the long term the nuface will save you a lot of money.",2015-08-25,5,5,AUAX1QWUCYKSX,B00BJ5XCBE
4726,"it must be kept in mind that this is a non-invasive treatment.  it is not a face lift.  i used the nuface on one side for three weeks, six days each week, with sundays off..  at first i did not see any change. after the 16th day i did see some change.  it was minor but it was improvement.  i was not sure if it was worth the time investment so i did not use it for one week.  i did see some very minor regression.  this doesn't actually lift or fill skin but after a routine of using this kit, my skin had a refreshed/rejuvenated appearance.  slight wrinkles/line were a bit less apparent.
if you lover pampering, i would recommend getting spa treatments.  if you do not mind the time needed to do this on your own, you will eventually save money.  it is not difficult but there is a time investment.  you use their gel and replacement gel is not terribly costly--between $10.49 and $13.
you can feel a bit of a vibration sensation but it does not shock or give any discomfort.",2015-08-25,4,3,ADY836HK6QSYR,B00BJ5XCBE
4727,"i've been using the nuface trinity trainer & wrinkle reducer for three weeks and i have seen improvement in my skin's elasticity, texture, and overall youthfulness. the device is easy to use and comes with the trinity trainer, wrinkle reducer (attachment), charging base & primer gel. immediately upon opening the box i plugged the device up to charge (it's suggested to charge for 12 hours) and read the instructions. i was impressed with the detailed instructions - i recommend watching the videos on nuface's website, as well as, youtube. the before/after pictures are quite dramatic and the customer comments on the nuface facebook page suggest people are very pleased with this device.

my experience thus far i would rate as better than average - it hasn't been the instant, omg what did you do? it's been subtle changes over the last three weeks that aren't so readily noticeable by people that see me everyday. however, my cousin (i haven't seen in about a year) noticed immediately! she said my face looked "rejuvenated" and had a "glow." which encouraged me to continue using nuface. if you are going to invest the money in this product, you have to invest the time to use it properly.

everyone is different, but this has been my daily nuface regiment:
  - wash face thoroughly, making sure all make up is removed, dry completely
  - apply primer gel in first area to be treated
  - i always begin with my right, lower jawline - starting at the earlobe, i slowly sweep across my face, to the nose (repeating this 3 times,
  as instructed) *if the gel starts to dry, i dab a drop of water on my finger tip, then gently swirl on my face, til the gel feels refreshed
  - i continue up the side of my face, in sections the width of the device (applying gel to each section as i go)
  - right side complete, i move to the left, lower jawline and repeat the exact same steps, moving or repeating a section when the device beeps
  - i then sweep my forehead and neck area (always in sections the width of the device)
  - lastly, i switch to the wrinkle reducer (slowly moving the device over my forehead, under eye to corner, face folds (aka laugh lines) & then
  under chin (neck area)
  - treatment complete, i clean the attachments with a cotton ball soaked in alcohol & then return it to the charging cradle
  i then apply my face cream. from start to finish about 24mins.

all of this sounds like a long drawn out process, but honestly it only takes about 22-24mins. and considering this can be done while sitting on the sofa watching television - it's really not a long time. it certainly doesn't seem like too much when you get results. of course we all like things to be fast and painless, but anything worth having is worth investing the time to get. that's the big thing with this device, you have to do it everyday, because results are cumulative. although there was nothing in the literature about acne, i did notice a substantial improvement in that area. the unit itself is chunky and heavy, very well constructed. however, if you have small hands, like me, it gets uncomfortable after prolonged use. simply resting a minute or so and you're ready to go. i mention it only to be thorough. turning it on, adjusting the strength of the current and switching attachments is easy. the dial on the front lights up blue when turned on, and with each click to increase or decrease, there's an audible beep. similar to that the device makes when you are using it, indicating it is time to move to the next section. there is a one year warranty, but you must register your device in order to activate it.
my main complaint with this kit, is what it lacks - i think all the face attachments should be included. i mean, wouldn't most people want to treat their entire face and to begin the treatment of all areas at the same time. that's why i think the eye and lip attachments should be included with the face trainer kit. hopefully, there will be others to voice this opinion and the company will offer a complete kit for the whole face.

in a nut shell - keeping in mind i've only used this product for less than 30 days and the suggested time is 60 days - if you are looking for a quick fix and fast, dramatic improvements, it would be best to call a plastic surgeon. if however, you are willing to dedicate yourself to using this device daily and have reasonable expectations, by all means, buy it! if your results are like mine, you will be glad you did!

4728,"i have been using this nuface trinity facial trainer 3 to 4 times per week, for the last 3 weeks and i have seen a noticeable difference in the jowl area of my face. the skin on my face is tighter, brighter and feels great. several people have asked me if i had recently lost weight because my face was thinner. i wonder if this would work on my beer belly? i have also used the wrinkle attachment and the fine lines and crows feet are gradually diminishing. i'm afraid to stop using this product because i'm worried that my skin will go back to the way it was before. i don't plan on stopping using nuface anytime so i shouldn't have anything to worry about. i'm excited to see the results after a few months use.

the device is simple to use and it feels surprisingly good. i like the tingling sensation it leaves on my face because it lets me know it's working. i highly recommend this product if you are a man or woman of a certain age who is noticing sagging skin, especially around the jowl area. it truly works wonders. i just wish i would have gotten  this a few years earlier as i'm sure the results would be even more dramatic.",2015-08-23,5,5,A2Z2FATA8JNL54,B00BJ5XCBE
4729,"it works. let me say that first because i didn't think it would. with that said you have to know that it is not permanent. my wife and i both used it. i stopped because it was painful and for what i was trying it out for,  it did nothing and i was afraid of creating more damage,  so i would nit recommend this for radiation damage. my wife used it on her forehead and it made a difference. it was not a huge difference but it was noticeable. it was not comfortable for her either and the effects were not lasting and she was not willing to continue. she wound have had to use it atleast a couple of times a day to keep it going and it was not worth it for her (her words).",2015-08-21,3,2,A2S26YGSVXBCFL,B00BJ5XCBE
4730,"first, my profile; 52, white female, aging sun damaged skin, semi-fit, about 12# over ideal weight; because fat does matter, especially when considering facial products and results. i am genuinely amazed that this device actually produced such significant results for me and literally, almost immediately! i used the nuface device for about 10 minutes, every day for 6 consecutive days. then stopped using it for 4 days to test the length of my results. manufacturer suggests using it 5 days a week for 6 to 8 weeks, then go to 2-3 days a week to maintain results.

the nuface trainer, literally lifted up my jowl sags and cheeks in just the first 2 treatments. i have never been able to 'lift' my aging jaw line, other than with my hands to hold them up in front of a mirror, and have been joking the past few years about eventually having to submit to a 'lifestyle lift'  because no skincare product alone could every reverse sag due to genetics, gravity, and little too much facial fat. until now. i am blown away.

this little machine has some type of micro current that when placed upon face with slight pressure and a gliding motion. it has lifted and toned my face like nothing i thought ever possible without surgery. it really is revolutionary for beauty and skincare age reversal. i don't work for the company or get any benefits, other than my own personal results from the product, it has just flat worked miracles for me!

now, the downside could be that in order to retain the lift, we have to consistently use the device! it doesn't take long, in as little as 5 minutes, but i have really focused extended treatments on my upper neck, jowls, lower and upper cheeks, for about a total of 10 -12 minutes each use. when i stopped using the product so i could review it here, i did notice since i had only been using it for one week, results began to 'sag' after the third day of not using the trainer daily as required. i started back last night and intend to follow the directions of use for 60 days, then start the maintenance schedule of 3x a week. i also have briefly used the wrinkle reducer led attachment, and love the feel of it, but have only used it twice, so i can't comment further until i know more.

also, the gel primer that comes with the nuface trainer is a must! it provides glide and allows the microcurrent of the device to penetrate the skin. i do use quite a bit, so re-ordering the gel primer will be necessary, about every 30 days, depending on usage. it feels great, and no objections to the primer, other than the cost to re-order as needed. but with the results i have experienced, it will be worth $20 a month to continue using the nuface device!",2015-08-17,5,5,A15OAS39003U5R,B00BJ5XCBE
4731,"i usually go to get a facial every three weeks.  i hate making the appointment, and i hate keeping it. i have issues with keeping and making appointments.  with that being said, using your nuface is a commitment.  you will need to make a date with your face for 15 minutes a night, five days a week.  you will see results, typically nuface asks to use the product for 60 days to see optimal results, but for vine, we have a timeline.  after 30 days of use, i noticed my complexion is brighter, the bags under my eyes are almost null, the wrinkle between my eyes is no longer front and center, and the skin along my chin line is firmer.

to use, there is a video to view first. there is a booklet showing the directions and patterns for usage.  the booklet says if you aren't pressing hard enough the device will beep three times - this never happened, not even when i held it in my hand and didn't press it to anything.  so my advice is don't press hard, but give it a little pressure.  if your gel dries on your face or you move the device where there is no gel, you will get zapped.  it's not awful, just, well, shocking.  i acidentally got to close to my nostril, and got an electrical charge to make my eyes tear up a little.

i watched several other videos of users.  if you are on the fence, i would suggest watching these.  one woman out there has been updating her nuface progress every month for two years.  she looks amazing, so check that video out, google nuface long lasting effects or something.  that's how i found it.

what i like, it doesn't take long.  i wash my face after dinner (when staying in) and for 15 minutes or less i hit my target areas, i wipe my face off, and  devore bed wash up, put on night cream.  you need a conductor gel, nuface comes with one, reorders are 12 dollars a tube.  i have seen several others use pure aloe. i did order some, but i haven't needed to use it yet.  my starter tube still has some gel.  what i don't like, you can not use an oil based cleanser before using nuface, apparently it is not as effective.  i normally like to use dhc olive oil cleanser to wash my face in the evening.  i feel that the oil replenishes my face.  so now at night i use my burt's bees cleanser before nuface and i use deep cleansing oil in the morning.  it is a commitment.  if you don't use it regularly, it won't do any noticeable lasting good.  it is expensive.  i figured that even though my salon was reasonable, going every three weeks at $50.00 a pop, plus tip - well it was worth it.

i admit, i'm vain when it comes to my face.  if my hair turns silver, so be it, but i would like youthful skin as long as i can.  i get facials because i had heard that regularly stimulating the face muscles and tissues was good for your face.  i had not tried electrical pulses before.  i am really pleased.  it is simple to use, i'm clumsy and awkward and i found this a snap.

one weird thing i noticed, i have a few places where i get a random hair on my face, i noticed that it grows faster since i started using nuface - it's annoying, but somewhere in my mind, i think this might be a sign that it is doing what it should be.  (renewing and stimulating cells). when i am done using the device, my face is mildly warm, not unpleasant, another sign that something appears to be happening.  i do think it works, aside from what i noticed, but my husband recently said that i must be getting more rest at night because that luggage i've been carrying under my eyes for the last five years is gone. (and they are gone, hopefully, not to return)

i have heard complaints about customer service or that you must always charge nuface when not in use - i can't speak to either claim.  i have had no trouble with the product at all.",2015-08-16,5,5,A89ZZKNDFQH23,B00BJ5XCBE
4732,"first off, i chose to use an aloe vera gel instead of the included gel. i wanted a more natural option that i could feel good about leaving on my skin. as long as i have enough aloe gel, i really don't feel any of the micro current. when i do feel it, it's not overly uncomfortable, just noticeable. the silver ball attachment is the toning. think of it like exercise for your face..it only works if you commit to it! but...it works! hang in there, give it a week or so of consistent use. i was disappointed at first since i didn't see an immediate difference as i had read could be possible. but, after using it for 5 days, in a row, i could definitely see a difference. what pleased me the most was the furrow between my brows lessened dramatically! that alone was enough to keep me using this. after over a month of consistent use my cheekbones appear higher and more defined due to the facial toning.
i found a video online that shows how to use it on other parts of the body. i regularly do my neck and have also used this on my hands.
the wrinkle reducing attachment is included in this kit. it should be used before the toning and must be used consistently for 8wks to expect any difference. i really feel like the red light treatment has helped reduce some old scarring on my face. it's so simple to do this light treatment. there's no gel needed and a mirror isn't even necessary. i do this first thing in the morning while having my coffee and reading the news. the flashing red light is obnoxious but i've gotten used to it. it also suggests you wear tinted goggles if the light bugs you.
overall, i am so, so pleased with the results of the nuface trinity trainer and attachment. at first it may seem like a time commitment but you adjust and the results are so worth it.",2015-08-16,5,5,A1KI3173CO6TK2,B00BJ5XCBE
4733,"i researched microcurrent technology and i found no journal articles stating that microcurrent works for either wrinkles or scars. there's been no conclusive evidence so far.

that said, i tested this for 2.5 weeks when i was alone without my family. this was perfect because then i could see what they thought when i returned. i used it 6 days a week and did the full treatment (with the original trainer and the ele attachment) nearly every day (there were probably 3 days out of the entire 2.5 weeks where i didn't have time for the ele attachment). when i returned, no one noticed anything different.

i had one coworker who told me i look good, well-rested. but there are so many variables there, being away from the family and work for 2.5 weeks could have been the reason for looking well-rested, i cannot attribute that to the nuface.

i, personally, did notice that my lips plump slightly when using the ele attachment. i noticed it particularly when doing half of my face (which is actually what they recommend). but it was no greater than the plumping i get from my favorite lip gloss.

overall, i personally wouldn't spend the money on this. however, if you go to the spa regularly to get these kinds of treatments that just make a hint of a difference, then it will pay for itself over time.",2015-08-07,3,3,A2SPV96SGOEO2,B00BJ5XCBE

4736,"first, i am in my early 40's, love to be in the sun and have always appeared younger than my age.  i wear very little make-up, generally only makeup on my eyes and maybe a bit of bronzer.
that said, i did not see the immediate removal of the fine lines around my eyes or mouth after use. what i did see an immediate improvement in the appearance of my skin.  difficult to describe but, my skin seemed brighter-not the faux puffy that you can get with some creams, this is an improvement in the texture and balancing the overall color of my skin.  in the am skin can look a bit "ruddy" with inconsistent coloring.  this helps to balance it. i am really happy with it and makes me less worried about running to the store or taking the kids to practice without taking time to put on make up.  there are many reviews out there celebrating lifting of brows and jowls-the small electrical current should contract the muscles and tighten them, like your face doing ab crunches, makes sense to me-so i am faithfully starting my day with the less than 5 min routine.
the unit should have no feeling, so if you feel "cold" or "pulsing" it is because you need a bit more gel and turning down the unit.  i could not, however, find a way to use it on my neck without discomfort.  there are several suggestions for less expensive gel's to use once the nuface gel has run out but for only $12 for a 2oz tube, i plan to stick with theirs.
there are many you tube videos that give how-to's and other ways to use the nuface trinity, which are helpful and entertaining:)",2015-08-02,4,5,A2MPXAJK3K61IY,B00BJ5XCBE
4737,"as noted, i'm still evaluating this item and i suspect that long-term use will reveal its benefits, or lack thereof.  so far, i haven't noticed huge differences, but i did feel that my brows looked a bit lifted immediately after use.  it also seemed to tighten up the area under my jawline.  i'm talking about incremental improvement, but it does seem to help.

i also used aloe vera gel in addition to the supplied gel, so perhaps that could save you money once you run out of the nuface provided product.  one does sometimes feel a mild tingling sensation, but hey it's electrical micro-current.  but it's not painful or especially unpleasant.

i'm going to try to continue to use this device daily and may upgrade, downgrade or add to this review depending on my future experience.  but 4 stars for now, as it does seem to offer some level of improvement.",2015-08-01,4,4,A13MKSASQ6YWL7,B00BJ5XCBE
4738,"when you spend this much for a beauty item, you want to make sure that a cheaper alternative would not work as well.  so before i used the nuface i spent a few days stepping up my beauty routine.  i masqued, exfoliated, biore-d, derma-rolled, and moisturized my face to get it looking its best.  then i asked my husband and my daughter to take a good look at my face under bright lights before and after.

note:  the nuface facial trainer is not meant to reduce wrinkles so much as it is meant to brighten, tighten, and fill out the face for an overall more youthful appearance.  though many people have noted a reduction in wrinkles, that is more what the led attachment (not included) is for.  if you have seen med spa advertisements for a "lunchtime face lift," they are talking about microcurrent facials.

the nuface is easy to use.  you just put a thin coat of the gel on your face, power it up, set it to your desired strength 1-5, and you are off.  my skin is not sensitive.  i started out on 3 but bumped it up to a 5 almost immediately.  when i did it near my jawline i had a slight metallic taste in my mouth, and sometimes i could feel the electricity but it wasn't even strong enough to be called a mild shock.  it felt like a gentle,  rapid tapping and was by no means unpleasant or painful in the slightest.  most of the time i didn't feel anything at all but the smooth metal balls gliding over my skin.  it is easy to get the timing right but no big deal if you don't.  for problem areas you can even hold it on one spot on your face for awhile without moving it.

i did half my face then asked my daughter to compare.  she quickly guessed which side i had done, stating that my skin looked better.  i personally noticed a bit of a brow lift.  when my husband came home that evening i asked him to take another look at my face and he said he could tell a difference as well.  i also took before and after pictures, and can tell a difference.  i have used it for three days now.  it is really easy to work into my routine.  i just wash my face in the morning, do the nuface for about 5 minutes, wipe the gel off, and go on about my day.

i decided to do some research on microcurrent as a beauty treatment, and found that it has been around for many years and popular with the hollywood set.  the level of electricity mimics what is present in the human body anyway, though that decreases with age, so it is completely safe for most of us.  people with pacemakers should not use it, people with thyroid issues should avoid the thyroid area, and everyone should avoid using it on the chest area to avoid getting your heart out of rhythm.  microcurrent started out as a medical treatment as a pain therapy and also to help people suffering from palsy or stroke to lift their drooping facial muscles back in place.  it stimulates your body to produce more collagen and more amino acids, both which lead to a more youthful and lifted appearance.  if you read unbiased reviews such as by users on youtube, etc., you will see that pretty much everyone loves it.  the nuface is not as strong as the "lunchtime face lift" microcurrent treatments advertised by med spas, but that just means it takes longer to see the full effect, not that they are less effective.  and five minutes at home each morning is easier, less time-consuming and less expensive than med spa treatments twice a week for six weeks, which is the recommended start up treatment, with less frequent follow-up treatments thereafter.  nuface does not interfere with facial injections such as botox or juvederm, though you should not use any microcurrent treatment for about two weeks after having the injections.  after that it is business as usual, and there is some evidence that microcurrent actually makes the injectables last longer and helps to reduce the amount needed.

yes, the nuface is expensive and is not for everyone.  however, if you have been tempted by the "lunchtime face lifts" or regularly get med spa treatments, or are just really not pleased with the signs of aging on your face and are willing and able to invest that kind of money, nuface is an excellent way to bring back some of the youthful skin tone, fullness and tightness.  it is a hefty initial investment, but check out the unbiased reviews for yourself, do your own research, and figure you can spend that cash now for a piece of equipment you can use quickly and easily in your own home for years, or you can get a handful of spa treatments that will last at the most a few months.",2015-07-31,5,5,AD1ZOPB0BBEHB,B00BJ5XCBE
4739,"let me start off by saying that i really like this device for a number of reasons, and i am somewhat prejudiced by my experience with microcurrent in working in the skin care industry - my former occupation. microcurrent can significantly improve the appearance of the skin over time but like exercise, the results are cumulative. it's recommended to take photos of your progress because your eye adapts to changes over time and can fool you very easily. with photos (before/after) you should be able to readily judge whether this machine is worth it within the 30 day time span given for  the nuface trinity. my motive is not to argue the merits for or against microcurrent, there is plenty of information online for and against it's effectiveness. my purpose is to determine whether it's a worthwhile investment for someone looking to avoid plastic surgery but who wants their skin to look it's best by less invasive methods. i personally have found microcurrent to work very well in the clinical setting, yet commitment to using it regularly is the key to visible results. with my own clients i always treated with microcurrent (toning) as a series of treatments rather than using it on it's own. those who want instant gratification are better off with surgery, and that's the case whether you want to do peels (and use products) or machines to reach your goals. the trinity is a toning device, it is useful for people who notice the muscles of the face slackening, it is not designed to change the surface of the skin. if you want to change the surface of the skin (wrinkles, large pores, etc.), peels and products are the way to go for home care usage.

the trinity feels substantial for a home use device, and the pulse is comparable with professional versions i've used in my clinic. that really is the most important feature....that it can pulse effectively in order to "train" the muscles into better condition. the machine itself is very easy to use, and can be used while watching tv, on the internet, or any task where you don't need your full attention. it takes 12 hr. to fully charge with the first usage onward. the trinity is very much like an electric toothbrush, it's cordless and rests in it's cradle ready for use. it's used with the gel (to create electrical conductivity with the skin) and it is important to use enough of the gel to get good contact. if you don't feel a pulse, or it feels uncomfortable on the skin, you need more gel. it should not dry out unless you're not using enough.

doing the steps (covering the face) can be done with a quick 5 min. session, or a more advanced 20 min. session that covers more areas of the face. note: you will be more likely to get results with consistent longer sessions if you can manage to find the time. the trinity is very light and comfortable to hold, and slides easily over the skin. this is a well designed "ergonomic" machine, a lot of thought went into it's design to get it right. this kit also includes a led head that snaps on and "helps with wrinkles and fine lines". led is an amazing bit of technology discovered by nasa, there is some scientific evidence to back up it's benefits in stimulating the skin to create collagen, new fibroblasts  (skin cells), and perk up the cellular mitrochondria. led can also be helpful for acne, although nuface doesn't mention this (perhaps due to their fda approval). anyhow, you may find the led helpful for problem areas too, and that's a cool feature. i personally do my passes on the face with the led first to wake up my cells, then proceed to using the microcurrent afterwards. my skin has a distinct glow, and yes, does look (and feel) toned after using the trinity. but, truth be told, led will not remove wrinkles, especially deep lines. in fact no home machine will, only something like laser or fillers will correct damage that's advanced due to aging or sun damage. however, led can improve the general texture and luminosity of the skin, and make it look younger and "more alive". this extra part of this kit makes the nuface trinity like 2 machines in 1, which would cost quite a bit more if you purchased separate machines for both tasks ( i.e.; microcurrent, and perhaps a baby quasar - the most popular home led device, would run about $1000). based upon that observation and the quality of the trinity (it's made to last years with good maintenance) i do feel that this machine is a great investment for your skin as long as your expectations are realistic and you can be committed to long term use. ironically, at least in my own experience, mature skin will "see" (visible) results faster than younger skin because the skin is in poorer shape, changes are readily apparent to the eye. so, give it time, you'll see results with photos, and remember that your patience will be rewarded....in time.

so, why am i giving this machine a 4 star review? actually i'd give it 4 1/2 stars if i could, but amazon won't let me. where i think the weakness with this kit is in not including the head for the eye and lip area with the rest of what you get. that's a separate item that will run you about $150. considering the price of this device, i don't think that the consumer should have to shell out more money to do the entire face. i'm sorry, that's just not cool in my book. it would be better to leave the led part out and simply sell a whole device for the whole face in one kit, no? or am i crazy...lol? i know my former clients would expect me to treat the whole facial area in the clinic and they also would deserve the best in their home care treatment if they are purchasing a luxury beauty kit like this. nuface, i hope you're listening.

tips: use of good skin care products will help as well, particularly those that give a mild peeling effect or help cells turn over. don't neglect your skin care routine even if you're using machines. avoid using the toning device directly on blemishes or open wounds, it just doesn't feel good and can irritate. if you have a lot of acne, proceed with caution with toning. only do a small area to see how your skin responds before doing the whole face. make certain your skin is clean before using the trinty so as not to spread bacteria, super important if you have acne. you can clean both the trinity toning & led heads with a swipe of alcohol after each use....a good habit to get into. i use hand sanitizing gel, myself.

fact: otc "at home" skin care must be used faithfully to get results and cannot cancel out poor lifestyle habits (poor diet, lack of sleep, smoking/drinking, hormone issues, etc.). these areas must be dealt with too, they impact your skin in a huge way. give up the toxins and your skin will look amazing with the tlc you're giving it.

what's in the box:

the trinity & it's cradle,  plug, facial toning & led heads, tube of gel

warranty (yes, you get a 1 yr. warranty, you must fill out the card to take advantage of it.)

guides; quick start, in depth guides for both the facial toning & led, and general usage guidelines.

**** it is highly recommended to visit nuface @ [www.mynuface.com/how-to] before using the nuface trinity, there are some well made videos that guide usage (the 5 and 15 min routines) and answer questions about the kit. this site is excellent in providing an in depth look at this machine and what it can do....even before you purchase. the before/after shots are impressive (check em' out!) and will give you a very good idea of what to expect, realistically speaking. you can also direct inquiries to their staff for support for the trinity, or get questions answered. i contacted them and found the company to be responsive, courteous, and very helpful.

nuface has quite an active facebook page for anyone interested in more info in a more "interactive way" on a social network where you can also see before/after snaps from users and get additional info and inspiration. they must be doing something right....they have over 14k members and many kudos from happy customers on the "posts to page" section. i highly recommend the nuface trinity as an effective anti aging and rejuvenation device that can give visible improvement to the skin, especially for mature individuals.

if you made it this far through this long winded review, you get a prize....the nuface is selling for $325 right now on their site with 10% off attachments (at the time of writing this review), and it comes in pink as well. if you want to save some cash, the nuface mini (without the led)  is a good option at $199  :)",2015-07-29,4,5,A2GA64WZK8PKBC,B00BJ5XCBE
4740,"so i just started usage of the nuface system today and will continue to update my review over the next 3 months. since it takes 60 days to really see results my star usage is purely based off of today's experience. the trinity was very easy to use out of the box. make sure you plug the device in well before you wish to start using it. it needs to charge for a while. the directions say 12 hours but mine was fully charged within 8. the easy directions recommend going to nufaces website and watching their how to videos and i do highly recommend that as well. they are very easy to follow so if you can have it on a phone or tablet play them while using the device the first few times. they have a basic 5 minute option, a more advanced 15 minute technique, and one just for the infrared anti wrinkle head. i did the 5 minute option with a jaw process i saw in the advanced technique video. you are basically pressing or slowly sweeping they device across your cheeks, forehead, and jaw on top of a slippery primer gel.

at first i thought that nothing was happening. then when i switched to both my jawline and my forehead i could suddenly feel a crackling, electrical sensation! it was not painful at all. i also have a tria hair removal laser and i would say it feels very similar. i don't even think doing all three areas took 5 minutes. i rinsed my face off and applied my usual skincare regimen. i don't know if it's just the primer gel or an affect of the laser but i feel like my skin absorbed my moisturizer better and keep touching my face because it feels so good! i'm sure the primer gel won't last the entire time i'm reviewing this but it's only $12 for 2 ounces on both amazon and sephora, though i have read that some people use aloe instead. i will be back to update!

update 12/11/15: so i used this just as the directions have instructed and i have mixed feelings on it. yes, my skin looks better for it! but was it from the actual product or from the daily cleansing and moisturizing regiment that accompanied it? i lean toward the latter. but i did notice a bit of tightening around the jaw. i predominantly used the regular head, not the infrared anti wrinkle head. i didn't see any change in light lines and creases. i am now trying to use the more time consuming infrared head and see if that makes a difference. i will update this again when i can give a definitive answer on that. it is a good prompt,if nothing else, to remind you to care for your skin. but the price tag is still a bit much.",2015-07-29,4,4,ATN4J5VS8Q0YM,B00BJ5XCBE
4741,"this nuface facial trainer kit is a quick and easy method to get a head start on mother nature when creases and wrinkles start to appear.  the technique is easy.  you remove your makeup, clean and dry your face, apply the nuface gel primer and then use the hand held micro-current device as directed.

you have starting and ending spots for each section of your face you are treating  for example if you are doing your chin line you start right beside you mouth and move the device in a smooth motion to your lower ear area.  the device has a built in 5 second timer that will beep when this motion should end.  there is also an adjustment so you can set the current flow to a position that is comfortable for you.

in this kit there is both the facial trainer that looks like steel balls and the ele wand which is a pronged device especially designed for the lips and eyes.  you get one tube of the gel primer so this trainer kit is ready to use as soon as you get it home.  it is suggested that for best results you use this regimen regularly 3 to 5 times per week.  i found it comfortable to use and had no ill effects from the micro-current.  the primer gels are readily available from both nuface and other distributors when replacements are needed.",2015-07-29,5,5,ATECU14VUIOJ0,B00BJ5XCBE
4742,"i am very torn in my review about this product.  one the one hand, i can't find any scientific literature that microcurrent facials actually work.  on the other, the product is well made and delivers an electrical current like the manufacturer claims.

to start, this product is very easy to use.  the conductive gel goes on easily.  the product beeps as you apply it to tell you when to start the next area.  this way, you don't over do the application to one area.  the charger and cradle are easy to use.  i like the way the device feels when i hold it in my handle.  it has a bit of heft to it.  changing the power settings is simple and the buttons are responsive.

the gel comes in a 2oz tube and i expect it to last about a month.  more tubes can be purchased on amazon and the price is more reasonable than i would have expected.

i was slightly scared to use the device for the first time, but to my surprised i only felt a tiny tingle as i used it. after the application, my face tingled for about 20 minutes, but the feeling went away with time.

i haven't noticed any results from using this device in my week of using it.  the maker claims that some users see changes right away, while others may take up to 60 days to see results.  i'll keep using the device and update the review when/if i start to see changes.

i'm still a bit hesitant to fully recommend this item given its price point and the lack of scientific studies.  however, if you want to give microcurrent treatment a try, then this device is an excellent choice due to its great build quality.",2015-07-27,4,5,A1BT6TL7UCIC5Y,B00BJ5XCBE
4743,"i have been using the nuface trinity facial trainer kit with the wrinkle reducer attachment for a few weeks now. best results take up to 60 days but i will give my best early impression now since i need to leave a review within 30 days in exchange for testing out the product.
this kit includes the facial toning device, wrinkle reducer attachment and a tube of primer gel. there are a couple of instruction booklets and the charger cable and cradle. i am impressed with the quality of the device itself. it is very well made and the curved design fits well both in your hand and on the contours of your face.
bonus points from me for being dual voltage for use overseas and for the charger having retractable prongs for travel or storage.
i have pretty average combination skin and have had no adverse reaction to using this on a regular basis.
i was especially concerned about the red light wrinkle attachment but it actually feels very pleasant during treatment - just a nice, warm feeling when pressed against your skin. it is not necessary to use the primer gel with the wrinkle attachment, which makes it easy for me to stick to a routine of using just before bed. i keep the device next to my bed and use it while catching up on netflix or listening to music. there is a built in timer so you don't have to watch the clock when using the device with either attachment.
it's too early to see what long term improvements there may be but i do like using this device. it makes me feel as if i am pampering my face and i like being able to do this in the privacy of my own home at my own convenience.
to get the best results, you need to make a serious commitment to using this as directed several times as week. but once i got comfortable with how the device works, it really has been easy to keep up with my routine.
i am a cynic when it comes to something like this but my skin certainly feels better than it did before. but the real test will be whether or not i see any significant improvement in the next 30 days. while this is a quality device that feels luxurious to use, unless it delivers the results it promises, it will not be worth the cost.
so stay tuned since i will definitely be back to update on my progress...",2015-07-26,4,5,A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO,B00BJ5XCBE
4744,"as i've gotten older i've noticed that my skin isn't as firm in some areas as it used to be.  i don't have a lot of wrinkles, but i have noticed a slight amount of sagging, especially around the jawline so i decided to try to head off any further decline with the nuface muscle trainer.

first i have to say, that i've haven't been as diligent as you need to be to see noticeable results.  sometimes i use it a couple of times a week, other times i've not done it at all.  even though the product is rechargeable the biggest downfall, other than the amount of time it takes and the cost of the gel, is that it needs to be on the charger for a long period of time and i have very limited space in the bathroom and only two outlet plugs.  the whole family uses this bathroom including small children so i don't feel like i can leave this out to charge like it needs to be in order for it to be ready to use as often as what you need to see the results i am after.  i wish the charges lasted longer and had a protective cap so that accidental zapping wouldn't occur.  i also wish that they would have included all of the attachments that are available for purchase into this kit considering the price.

from what i read from other reviewers, the manufacturer has significantly improved this version of the nuface from the old one. i can only hope that when they decide to revise it again that they will take some of these things into account.

if i had it to do over would i get it again?  considering everything, probably not.  that being said, i do feel that i've seem some change for the better so i do  believe that this product works.  i guess i just need to decide if i'm just going to try to age gracefully and let nature take it's course, or if i am going to work around the issues that i have and be regimented about using this product regularly to see even better results.",2015-04-03,3,4,A3AL9NFNWTRV39,B00BJ5XCBE
4745,"i have only been using this product for about two weeks. before using this device, the instructions advise removing all make up, wash your face, and apply the included gel. the gel is odorless and wipes off easy, but messy after you apply it to your entire face. as for the actual device, it delivers light electrical shocks as you run it over the gel on your face. it does sting a little bit, but not so much that i would describe it as painful, even on the highest setting. after completely the treatment, my facial muscles do feel tighter/twitchy, but i have not seen noticeable results yet. i will continue to use the product for a little while longer, but i am beginning to get bored with the process without seeing any results.

 i was slightly disappointed when i first received this product and discovered that the attachments shown on the box are not included and must be purchased separately.",2015-03-12,3,4,A20V7N5A22F4BM,B00BJ5XCBE
4746,"as a vine reviewer, i am required to post a review after 30 days. because this is well under the manufacturer's suggested time with the product, this review only covers my first experience with the nuface itself, not its effectiveness.

pros

build quality: other reviewers have complained about the build quality of the nuface, but i think it's quite nice and, as a designer, i have a pretty high bar. granted, it looks a bit like a frog, but overall it's quite nice.

ergonomics: the nuface feels good in the hand.

cons

charging light: why oh why do products intended for bedrooms and bathrooms insist on bright, blue lights? studies show that blue light triggers the brain to wake up. the light the nuface emits while charging is bright enough to illuminate my entire (rather large) master bathroom. i really don't need a "facial trainer" to be the most prominent thing in my bathroom. nor do i need it to trigger me to wake up every time i make a midnight pitstop. silly and unnecessary.

uncomfortable: this isn't the most comfortable treatment. you'll feel a mild sting throughout the process. and if you have a problem with acne, forget about it. i've noticed that even the slightest facial blemish, scratch, or sunburn is irritated, rather profoundly, but the electrical current given off by the nuface.

as for effectiveness, i'll update my review after i've had more time with the product.",2015-03-08,3,5,AI5OS4RQQIUMJ,B00BJ5XCBE
4747,"i realize that using this product is a marathon, rather than a sprint. i am in my 30s and started noticing lines around my mouth recently, which is something that drives me crazy. i am willing to invest the time, for vanity sake.

this product requires an initial 12-hour charge and nightly charges after that. most importantly, the toner gel that is included (and quite small, no big enough for a marathon)  needs to be used with the facial trainer, without it...not pleasant. i am using aloe vera as the gel in the interim because that gel is so dang expensive.

i have noticed a slight difference in my facial muscles and continuing my daily use to continue to see more. will update as results become more clear.",2015-03-07,4,4,A3F2926FPOBNL,B00BJ5XCBE
4748,"i rated nuface trinity four stars because it seems like a good home based treatment that can save you a lot of money in the long term. this is fda-cleared, multi-solution, skin care device innovatively-designed with interchangeable treatment attachments  that are suppose to help rejuvenate and improve your appearance. the product is designed rather on the larger side, than what i had imagined it to be more comfortable holding and the metal spheres to be smaller aswell. there is a gap between both spheres, which i would have preferred a flat surface for better coverage of the entire wrinkle line.

i was drawn to this product to help reduce my deep forehead wrinkles. the directions were easy to follow and they suggest that you use it for atleast 5 days per week and 5 minutes per day. i have not done it consistently for atleast 5 days per week but i have done it for nearly 5 minutes at a time and have not seen results. the beeping is loud, even my husband came into the bathroom to ask what that beeping noise is lol.

overall, this nuface is worth a try, i would have loved to try out the trinity wrinkle reducer attachment, since i don't need much help with this toning/facial trainer. i may end up testing this product on other part of my body, like thighs, to see if it improves cellulite. tip: make sure the gel primer doesn't dry out because it can feel like a zap without it.",2015-03-07,4,4,A8QYRG7TW491B,B00BJ5XCBE
4749,"i realize there is no magic pill, bullet,or device to aid in anything related to the human body, specifically when it comes to aging. i am reviewing this as a vine reviewer, who had 30 days to do so. i am reviewing this exactly 30 days after receiving it. so, when i tell you i've only started to see some signs of progress, i am more hopeful than anything that in the following weeks what is promised will be delivered.

granted, anything worth doing is worth doing right. so, be patient. the good thing is is that this ergonomic device is rechargeable and very portable. you can do the training on the go which helps in setting your schedule. from what i've seen and then read, this will take some time.

it works by providing a mild electrical current to stimulate facial muscles back to a more youthful firmness. (don't be stupid. check with your doctor if you already have electrical devices in your body.) i am trying to lose weight  and as such, certain parts of the body shrinks more quickly than the other. one of those is the face. so, this has come in handy  or will come in handy  when i start to lose what the chunkiness once held taught.

make sure your face is clean beforehand. they give you a gel to help cleanse it, but i would recommend an off-the-shelf cleanser and to make sure you really dry your face. some users are reporting shocks. i suspect that this is because they didn't learn that electricity and water are a shocking combination. understand as well that you can turn down the intensity of the current.",2015-03-06,4,5,A1O2QIQK2OR5TC,B00BJ5XCBE
4750,"my first caveat would be to keep this item, while charging, in a hidden spot, or warn everyone not to pick this item up and try to use.  it will shock you, especially if you do not have the gel primer liberally applied everywhere you will applying this machine.  so beware of you have young, curious children, or an impulsive husband.

it is of utmost importance to apply the primer gel on every skin surface that you will be touching with the device, or you will definitely receive an unpleasant shock.  a very small tube of the primer gel is included.  perusing prices for a replacement tube, a 2 oz tube goes for $12 and a larger, 5 oz tube goes for $40.  one tube does not last ling, especially if more than one person wants to use this device.  i've seen on other reviews where people just buy a big tube of ultrasound gel, and i think that would be a wiser choice.  i guess getting folks to buy the gel is how this company is making their money.  especially since continuing and long term commitment to this treatment is necessary to get and keep results.

instructions indicate some folks will see results immediately.  i have not.  i am 46 years old and do not have many deep or even fine wrinkles, except for some very small ones by my mouth and some on my forehead, so i will continue to treat those areas, as well as attempt to tone my jaw line also.  my husband is 50 and just has more wrinkles that i do (genetics!)  he is also using this item.  we will update as we see, or don't see, results.

i wish the item didn't need to sit in the charger cradle all the time.  the lights are annoying and bright.

if you do purchase this item, be prepared to spend a lot of time using it.  it does require a certain level of time and commitment, so i'm not going to express all my skepticism at this time regarding the results.  we shall see.  i will revisit and update my review at a future date.",2015-03-01,3,5,A2CUWCJHUPGL9W,B00BJ5XCBE
4751,"when i was offered the nuface trinity trainer kit to try out, i was intrigued.  i turned 40 this past year and am definitely feeling the lure of products that promise younger looking skin, so i looked forward to trying this product.

first, i would definitely suggest watching the video which demonstrates use of the trainer rather than just relying on the written instructions (there is a website for the video in the product manual).  for three weeks, i've been taking the time to use the nuface trainer as directed.  as long as i have the right amount of gel coverage, there is no sensation.  however, i also don't see noticeable results.  i will continue to use the kit as directed and am being a bit generous with the rating just in case long term use is the key.  i plan to update my review accordingly if after a longer period of time i still see no difference.

although the video shows use of attachments, this kit doesn't come with those parts -- and they cost a pretty penny.  if you already have signs of aging that you want to minimize, i'd suggest sticking to a good skin care routine and trying an over the counter anti-aging cream.  i haven't bought one yet, but there do seem to be some products that can help.

if you are simply hoping to preserve the youthful skin you already have, don't smoke, use sunscreen, drink plenty of water, eat a healthy diet, and use a good moisturizer.",2015-02-27,3,4,A14E7LZASLSX36,B00BJ5XCBE
4752,"wow! i have never tried a microcurrent facial stimulation device before and i noticed a difference right away! i am not a young person, so that may be why my skin appeared smoother and tighter so fast. if i skipped a day, it seemed that the smoothness did not last. i am going to use it daily instead of at least five times per week. you need to use the device for 60 days (at least five times per week) before you can reduce the number of days per week, but i have not used it for that long and had to complete a review in 30 days. still, i think the results i have seen so far are remarkable! to maintain results, you must use this device 2-3 days per week. now my daughter is trying it as well to see if it evens out her skin tone.

what is in the box
1 nuface trinity facial toning device
1 nuface trinity facial trainer (microcurrent attachment)
1 nuface tube of gel primer
1 charging cradle + power adaptor
1 user manual and quick start guide
1 year warranty (send in the registration card)

what is not in the box
extra attachments (you receive one facial trainer attachment) for the trinity device - trinity wrinkle reducer (full-face fine lines and wrinkles) and trinity ele attachment (for lip and eye areas). these attachments are sold separately.

you need to charge the device for at least 12 hours prior to first use. you should watch the how to video at the url provided in the quick start guide & read the user manual. the instructions advise the user to test the gel primer on the skin of your inner arm for sensitivity 24 hours prior to use.

i used both the gel primer and pure aloe vera gel as well. i could not tell a difference between the two but you need to keep enough wet gel on your facial skin for the microcurrent to be conducted well. i could tell when the gel was too thin or dried out when i felt a slight sting sensation. you need to glide the device in specific patterns of sweeps and repeat three times. you can also add a series of advanced positions by positioning and then lifting and holding, and then repeating three times. the device indicates when the end of a sweep or position is over by a beep. there are about 5 seconds between beeps. total time per treatment varies from 5 minutes to 20 minutes depending on whether you choose the basic sweeps or add the advanced lift and hold positions. you use a wet cloth to remove the gel after treatment. i find that i really need to rinse my entire face with water because the cloth takes longer since it needs to be rinsed over and over. highly recommended!

the nuface website states that an extended 2-year warranty is available for purchase but it must be purchased before the original one-year warranty has expired by contacting a representative at (888) 360-9171. i have not attempted to extend the warranty yet.",2015-02-25,5,5,A22RIIYSPA3EDH,B00BJ5XCBE
4753,"i have been using this daily for two weeks. so far, i haven't noticed any difference in the texture of my skin. this does not mean the device does not work. the included brochure states that it can take up to sixty days to see results. there are some peer-reviewed studies that indicate that microcurrent treatments can improve firmness, but not wrinkles. time will tell.

this device is easy to use, attractive, and charges well. however, it does take a commitment to use this on a daily basis.

some of the side effects of using this product include: eye twitch during treatment, metallic taste in the mouth. when i get anywhere near the hairline with this device, my scalp twitches as well.

a tube of gel is included with this product, but it doesn't last very long. i will soon need to buy another tube, which can add up over time.

bottom line: this device can help improve skin firmness, but requires a significant commitment of time and money. it is also not very pleasant to use. do i plan to keep using it? yes. i need to give this a chance. would i recommend it to friends? at this point, i'm not sure that i would.",2015-02-20,3,3,A2ZWTFZRNQW7D5,B00BJ5XCBE
4754,"this is not a quick fix. "training" your face will take weeks if not months to see results and you will need to continue using it to keep those results (whatever they maybe). i started using the nuface for only a few weeks ago but i have seen some improvement in the "tone" of my face. keep in mind that i'm 40 and only have a few fine lines around my eyes, forehead and only very minor sagging around the jaw line.  but i believe in being proactive so i gave nuface a try.

first of all i urge anyone to watch as many of the youtube videos you can on how to use this product; thats what i did and they were extremely helpful.  second don't start on the recommended highest setting (it may really hurt as it did for me) but instead start on the lowest and gradually work your way up. third, work in small sections. the gel primer they provide dries really, really fast and you need it for the nuface to work.  you don't want to "pull" the skin upward but "slide" on the gel upward.  the best tip i got was to keep a spray bottle of water handy and spry between treatments to keep the skin moist, otherwise you have to stop and apply the gel all over again.  finally, after you've used up all your gel buy something cheaper i.e. aloe vera will work just as well.

***best tip i can give anyone is to purchase from a place with a great return policy because it will take a while to see (if any) results and this is a major investment.",2015-02-18,4,5,A2NICGGIGIFU22,B00BJ5XCBE
4755,"i'm a complete skeptic when it comes to things like this, so i want to start out with the two most important words:  it works!

i tried this on half my face so that i could really see if there were results.  the improvement in my skin was obvious and results came quickly.  in fact, i rather quickly moved on to doing my whole face so that i didn't look like some comic book villain with half a lovely face and half...not.

this is very easy to use and doesn't take too much of a time commitment each day.  though the feeling was startling (not painful) at first, it soon became pleasant.

4758,"this little facial trainer looks like an alien frog, but don't be deceived.  it provides enough microcurrent to make faces take notice and improve texture and facial contouring.  i use it each evening, and i can feel the microcurrent (i have it set on medium power).

after a weeks use, i see my skin tone becoming more even, but i am hoping for more  much more.  my skin is visibly aging, and i want to see the wrinkles and other unpleasant features of aging skin leave for good.  i suspect it will take several months for this to happen, but this is what im hoping for.  right now, im using it daily, but after i get the results i want, i anticipate scaling back to every other day.

does the microcurrent hurt?  its noticeable and not very pleasant, but it does not cause much pain.  because i already had a tens unit, i was not surprised by the tiny discomfort caused by the microburst.

the unit beeps when its done its job, so you know instantly when each stroke is complete.  a video on the website will show you exactly where to place the unit and for how long.  i find it very easy to use according to these instructions.

overall, its a good unit that i hope will bring me extraordinary results like some of the photos on the website.  ive taken before photos and will be able to tell how much my face is improving as i go through the process.

five stars! (subject to revision according to my results)",2015-02-10,5,5,A240FRPD4MEXND,B00BJ5XCBE
4759,"**this review will be updated in two months' time with data about facial results.**

there is no doubt this thing is doing something. i feel almost an electric shock if i use it with a wee less gel. the results will take time to see, however. i am not seeing anything instant. my goal with this device is to get rid of the look of a double chin and the lines around my mouth.

there are immediately a few things i'm not crazy about though. the blue light when it charges...annoying. i wish there was a way to turn it off. i tend to charge things while i'm sleeping and this light was so bright, i had to close the bathroom door.

also, i'm deaf and i don't find having to "listen" for beeps very helpful at all. i would appreciate if they'd come up with something else. perhaps a light where one can see it whilst using it. a flash.

the instructions are easy to follow though. no complaints there. you charge the device 12 hours, you put gel on your face (provided), you hold the shiny balls in place (illustrations show you where) and glide it to another place until you hear a beep. repeat in a different location.

again, this review will see continuous updates when more time has passed.

**after a few days of using this, i am not seeing results (don't expect to yet) but i am getting pimples where i use the device. this is not normal for me. i may try using something besides the gel they sent. a previous reviewer said she uses aloe vera. i may try that.",2015-02-06,3,4,A3THYM7XMB8B0U,B00BJ5XCBE

normally, this isn't my thing, but i am not getting any younger, and i figured, "what the heck?"

it was very easy getting everything out of the above average packaging, and separating the various parts.

following the directions was simple. they were well written, with just enough science type language to make me feel as if this might have some legitimate basis to it.

i was a little nervous about the micro current, but it wasn't bad at all, and even felt a bit nice after i got used to it.

i probably did not go an entire five minutes, but i have a short attention span.

i am going to make an effort to try this regularly for a long enough time that i can return and let everybody know how well it worked.

4762,"i'm not above being vain and admitting that age isn't being kind to my face, so i've been looking at options other than botox and fillers in order to stave off the inevitable so the nuface trinity sounds like a decent idea in theory. in order to get any real benefits, you're going to have to use this 3-4x a week for upwards of 8 weeks. i gave it a daily use for 3 weeks in order to get a review in, and i didn't notice anything in my face (nor did my wife, for what it's worth.) i even took photos of my face before i got started to see if it there was anything noticeable and didn't see anything. it's not to say that if i kept going for another 2 months that i might notice something - but i'm impatient. this item is definitely not for the impatient. a few of the youtube reviews along with the amazon reviews i've watched seems that 8+ weeks is the consensus on seeing visible results. i'll reevaluate at 8 weeks to see if it's worth sticking with.

a few things: the unit itself feels pretty flimsy, and i was worried that with an accidental drop, it would shatter. granted, i'm not going to drop it to test it out, but for a device that's upwards of $300, it doesn't feel like there's that quality associated with it. also, the gel primer went fairly quickly it seems, and that adds to the cost of the overall kit - i'll probably need to buy a few more over the next two months. additional attachments also run $150 or so, so this is clearly a system that would require a sizable financial commitment (along with the heaps of time!)

overall i'm conflicted - the tons of positive reviews give me hope that this will eventually help out problem spots, but the time and financial commitment might make me consider the path of least resistance: a cosmetic dermatologist (or at least, a dermatology residency clinic.) but nuface does give a 60 day money back guarantee, which i would expect (but only from nuface's site it seems and at the time of writing this review, it's nearly $50 cheaper than amazon!) but if you've decided to invest in the nuface trinity, you'll probably be investing an hour a week in using this on your face in addition to gel primer regularly.

4763,"as a product tester, i am required to post a review within 30 days of testing a product.  i do believe this product will take longer than 30 days to show its desired results, so i hope to post an update to this review within the next few months.

i believe the nuface trinity is a revolutionary product.  it was important to me that the product had received clearance from the fda, which it has.  the device is designed to provide a solution for multiple skin care concerns.  it is designed to work with multiple treatment attachments, but it is important to note that the microcurrent attachment is the only one included with the trainer kit.  the microcurrent attachment is meant to gently and effectively stimulates the surface of your face to help improve your skin's appearance.  the other attachments are sold separately, and require somewhat of an investment.

in just a few days, i can honestly say that i have noticed some difference in my facial contour and skin tone.  i am banking on the accuracy of the clinical studies which state that after 60 days of use, 85% of users experienced improvements in facial contour, and 73% of users experienced improvements in skin tone.  i am personally looking for improved facial contour and skin tone around the forehead, eyebrows, jawline, and jowls.  if i continue to notice improvement, i will seriously consider purchasing the ele (effective lip and eye) and wrinkle reducer attachments.  but, since each attachment is $150, i would like to see significant results from the microcurrent attachment first.

to use the trainer, i cleanse my face thoroughly and apply the nuface gel primer.  then, i simply glide the trinity facial trainer over the natural contours of my face for roughly five minutes each day.  when finished, i remove the nuface gel primer and apply my favorite skin care (vitamin e moisture cream).  the instructions indicate that when i begin to achieve desired results, i can reduce the frequency to two to three days a week.

nuface trinity is an ergonomic handheld design making the process very effortless.  so far, i am very pleased with the product and its early results.",2015-01-30,4,5,AFYQ9V4XBVCJ1,B00BJ5XCBE

i would also recommend the suzanne somers facemaster to use along with this item. the facemaster is great with small wrinkles around eyes and detailed work. you need to use two hands with the facemaster and i like that the trinity only requires one hand. that way you are free to multi task! these at home wrinkle and age support products do require use three or more days per week. it's just like working out, you will lose the toning if you don't keep doing it!!

there's not too much fragrance in the product, which is a big bonus. since one really needs to rinse thoroughly, whatever fragrance there is is gone after washing. i use a thick washcloth to help remove the product. the only downside (not enough to take away a star from this review) is that it rather feels like using shampoo on one's face. i'm not crazy about that, but i love the results so much that i don't mind.

because i'm a member of the vine program, i have to review this earlier than i would care to. whether or not it lightens my age spots remains to be seen. if it does, i'll amend this review, but i can't add any stars! honestly, i've tried so many products meant to cleanse dry clean and none of them do such a good job as this one.

for years, when friends were coming back from europe, i would beg them to tuck some laroche posay products in their suitcase for me. i couldn't be happier, now that the company has many of their wonderful products available here in the united states.
this deep cleansing brightening cream is suitable for most skin types. it is non drying and non irritating, and offers mild exfoliation. there are a lot of products on the market that tend to overestimate themselves, this is not one of them. squeeze a bit of the opalescent cream onto your hand or better yet, your clarisonic device, and add enough water to bring up a milky foam.
don't expect a lot of oversudsing. like most european products, they don't have an overabundance of useless  lather that is the result of questionable chemicals.

the exfoliating quality seemed very non-abrasive and gentle.
i have no idea if it will actually improve the look of my skin with prolonged use, as they claim, but i like it a lot after only short term use.

i was also surprised at just how 'strong' it was. when i rinse it off my skin feels as though every tiny bit of oil is gone and i remain surprised at just how little an amount you need to squeeze out to get a bunch of lather.

so i like it. do i like it $25 for a 4 oz tube enough. i don't think so, but on sale i'd probably buy it. and to be fair, i might anyway, as a very small amount foams up to be far more (and works well) than i expected, so i keep reducing the amount i need to use, which means this may last longer than i thought. i'm hoping that the $25 is an intro price and that it goes down because as i get used to it i don't want to give it up.",2015-11-29,5,3,AR74YY08IP2WE,B00ES5KT54

with that said, the quality of this product does seem more superior to other serums i have tried, and leaves my skin smooth. i hope with longer use that i will continue to see more benefits on my skin.",2017-06-29,4,5,A2FN8FBQAKOZ3B,B00F6XZVXC

4879,"ive never tried using a vitamin-c serum on my face, but i was intrigued, so i decided to give obagi professional-c serum 10% a try.  im in my forties, and my skin is starting to show its age with some dullness and fine (and not so fine) lines.  i found the difference in my skin after using this product to be very subtle, especially after only a couple uses, but after several weeks, i think the overall appearance of my skin has improved.  ive definitely noticed my skin seems healthier, brighter, and more radiant.

im pretty critical of the fine lines on my face, and ive only noticed a very subtle improvement there.  however, my best friend of 30 years recently asked me what i was doing because she thought i looked so much younger than all our other friends our age.  im sure some of that has to do with common sense changes ive made like drinking more water and making sure i get more sleep, but i have to wonder if maybe obagi professional-c serum 10% has helped improve my skin more than i notice in the mirror on a daily basis.

while i plan on continuing to use this product, i will warn that, at first, this product stings a bit.  i believe the packaging warned about tingling, but the first couple uses caused me more of a stinging sensation than a tingling sensation.  now that my skin is used to it after several weeks of use, it doesnt bother me at all.  overall, i think this is a good product that has brought a more youthful glow to my face, and i like that.",2017-04-06,4,4,AZMISC9FAUBIR,B00F6XZVXC

4881,"i have used various obagi skin care products over the 25 plus years and even visited the doctor in his la location many years ago. they are good products, albeit they can often cause irritation to the face and sometimes that's even intentional as the product acclimates to the skin.  as good as they are, there are things you need to know before you start.

their tonics and skin moisturizers are great and recommended for all, but their products that have retinols and c-serums or other so-called age-reducing products should be used with care and you might want to start start slowly and carefully.

i have not used any obaji products for a while and started right in with this 20% solution on day one and should have known better. i put it on my forehead and no problems. so day two i spread it on my cheeks and sure enough, when i woke up the next morning my cheeks almost looked like i had a rash.

so i stopped the product right away and went back to using it with skin moisterizes and using it every third day. the skin on my cheeks started getting more used to it (which you probably will) and i can now use it more often. it is effective.

 i would strongly recommend that you start with the 10% solution first and even at that, be careful and start using it every other day. use moisterizers in between if need be.

i do think that this c-serum creme is effective but do realize that it may take some time for your skin to get acclimated to using it and for many people, that may not happen at all. for that reason i would suggest trying it on a small portion of you skin at a time;  not right on your cheeks or other really noticible spot right on  your face. see if you can handle the product after some period of time (i.e. no rash-like reaction.)

recommended for some. i'd start with the 10% and gradually increase till you can use without any skin irritation.",2017-03-29,3,5,A2GPJR489OIH42,B00F6XZVXC

pluses:
-the dropper system is exceptional. it prevents in accidental cross-contamination (since, essentially, this should never actually touch anything). moreover, the curvature of the dropper allows the user to get all product before disposing of the bottle (instead of doing that awkward holding-the-bottle upside-down thing).
-the blue glass offers protection against sun degradation.
-the strength and results are out-of-this-world! (even with my sensitive skin ... i have had no adverse reactions. just touchable, glowing skin. seriously.)

potential minuses:
-the smell is akin to cough syrup. but, the good news is that one does not notice it after a few minutes.
-the price is wildly inflated. i have used&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/philosophy-turbo-booster-vitamin-c-powder-7-1g-0-25oz/dp/b005flrdnq/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8">philosophy turbo booster vitamin c powder - 7.1g/0.25oz</a>&nbsp;for about five years now. it is a fraction of this price and offers comparable results. likewise, the philosophy product is in a powder form and can be added as desired to any variety of products.

4885,"i am a big believer in the need to incorporate a c serum into the daily routine and have tried a dozen different c products, from the gold standard serum that includes ferulic acid (but only 15% vitamin c vs 20% in this product) to no-name brands that i've found here on amazon, many with lots of dubious 5-star reviews. i've concocted my own c using recipes that are readily available. this is the most potent c serum i've used, and so far it's blowing away the competition. no fragrance other than the ingredients themselves, easily and quickly absorbed, well-formulated to let c do its thing.

my only issue is with the delivery mechanism. i'm sure there's a reason for the angled dropper, but at first i had a hard time getting the drops to go where i wanted them to go. problem solved by applying drops while lying with my head back. if you're more coordinated than i am, this won't be an issue for you.

4886,"i have never used obagi products before, and after using this i really think i have been missing out on some really great products. for vitamin c serums (which i have used for several years) i have generally used philosophy's turbo c powder or the serum from mychelle. i like the powder because it can be mixed in with my other facial lotions and i can kill two birds with one stone. i used to love the serum from mychelle, but something changed in the formula and now it's super stinky and super sticky. a huge plus for this serum is that it isn't sticky or bad smelling. i apply this at night so my skin isn't also exposed to other products or makeup while this serum works. i am already very fair skinned, so i don't use this so much for brightening as i do for fading scars from acne or overall skin tone. due to the high concentration, i use this every other day in order to give my skin a break. super strong concentrations of vitamin c can cause redness, peeling, tingling, or burning, so it's important to use this as directed, use sunscreen, never mix with alpha hydroxy acids (aha and vitamin c cancel each other out so you end up wasting product and your money), and don't use on broken skin. i use this mainly on my oily t-zone because it's wonderful at providing a way to minimize oil production. for my cheeks wihich tend to get very dry, even in the summer, i skip this because it tends to make these areas of my face flake.

the one big downside to this product is the way it dispenses the serum. ascorbic acid oxidizes when exposed to air, so getting the vitamin c in a pump or tube form where it has minimal exposure to the air is ideal. the powder form is good because while it will oxidize, it doesn't do so as fast as it would in liquid form. this obagi serum is exposed every time you unscrew the dropper. not only is it being exposed to the air, but it is also being exposed to more contaminants that a pump or tube based serum is not. this is why i knocked off a star. there are better ways to design and safely store this product. of course the outrageous price is a problem here as well. $115 for a bottle. other sites list this for the same price, but wow. makes me glad this will last longer by only using it every other day.",2017-03-08,4,5,A1LINA8MCSONQL,B00F6XZVXC

i detect a faint smell of green apple, although no fragrance is listed.",2017-03-08,5,5,A11OTLEDSW8ZXD,B00F6XZVXC

4889,"my dermatologist recommended the obagi line of products, and i have been using their toner for years. i was thus happy to have the opportunity to review the professional-c serum.  (and, as a middle-aged woman, i could certainly use it!)  the serum is designed to diminish the appearance of fine wrinkles. you are instructed to apply 5-7 drops on your face daily. the packaging warns that you may feel some discomfort or tingling the first few applications; i did in fact feel a very slight--but not at all uncomfortable--tingling the first few times i tried it.

this is not like a concealer or other product where you're supposed to see immediate results, so i have waited six weeks before writing this review. i will say that there is a noticeable difference--my face looks smoother, and the coloring more even, than before.  is it a big enough difference to justify the expense?  that i'm not sure of, but then again, i don't dye my hair or wear makeup, so perhaps i'm a bit more accepting of the natural changes of aging than the target audience for these kinds of products.

one possible helpful hint:  be very careful when applying the drops.  if you accidentally get it in your eyes, you will be in a world of pain. don't ask me how i know.  :(",2017-03-04,4,3,A14L2638XC00EZ,B00F6XZVXC
4890,"i have been using this serum every night for a month now, and have enjoyed it since the first use. i have used one other specific, vitamin c product, which was the la-roche posay active c-10 serum. i really liked the la-roche posay--but i love the obagi professional-c serum. i definitely think this serum is more effective at brightening and smoothing the skin.

for how expensive medical grade skincare can be, there is a certain expectation the product will perform better (because of higher concentrations of effective ingredients) and thus be worth the extra cost. i think the cost is worth it with this serum in particular because of how liquid it is. the bottle is a glass vial with a dropper. i use the dropper to drop the serum directly on my face, and usually have to work in sections because it starts to travel down so quickly. it spreads out very nicely, though. a few drops go a long way. it's not watery or diluted feeling--it is simply low viscosity. i would compare how viscous it is to hot, runny syrup, minus the stickiness and everything else :) at present, the remaining product in my bottle is about 1/8" below the top of the label (yes, i actually measured..haha). i've been using it generously for a month. i think it will last me several more months.

this serum sinks in very quickly, and compliments my other skin care. i have heard to alternate a retinol/retinoids and vitamin c, but have been using both every night (although the retinoid i use is low strength--avene triacneal night. it is not pure retinol by any means). i also use benzoyl peroxide (la-roche posay effaclar duo) sporadically. i'm no expert, but wanted to disclose the other products i'm using. they are all playing nicely.

when i wake up in the morning, my skin feels fresh and glowing, with a nice bounce and more even texture and tone. i am 32 with oily, mildly acne-prone skin, and have had no breakouts, reactions, or sensitivity to this product-- although i do not have particularly sensitive skin. the first few times i used it, there was a very slight stinging sensation, which went away in a few seconds. i didn't think anything of it, because i have used aha/glycolics so much that i almost expect it. this particular serum is the lowest, most gentle concentration out of the three obagi professional-c serums that are currently offered--and is recommended for sensitive and very dry skin. although i received this product via the vine program, i would definitely purchase another bottle. i'd love to bump up to 15% or 20% on the next one, though :) five stars.",2017-03-04,5,3,A3HZ687GB0AH7Y,B00F6XZVXC

4893,"ok, now i am very impressed with this particular brand's quality.  i have a few other items from obagi.  they are pricey, yet so worth the money in my opinion.

i applied some drops of this vitamin c professional serum on my fingers to smooth on my face, neck, and chest.  this liquid smells wonderful; the texture is slick.  so slick that i need to watch getting it all over the bottle, ok?  the foil-covered bottle top has a cap which gets replaced by a dropper cap.  i see a visible difference in the appearance of my skin.  wow.  i am so self-conscious about those deep lines i am getting above my lips as well.  i felt this product going on like silk, leaving me moist and perhaps a tad primed for the moisturizer, perhaps after cleansing, or followed up by some other treatments perhaps.  it is to be used day and night.

obagi professional-c serum 20%, 1 fl. oz.  it is an antioxidant formula for all skin types.  i am not sure what the fragrance is.  this is very concentrated.

also, this comes with an information booklet.  it covers different formulas from this company, and what they are for.  it has instructions.  nothing complicated about this to worry about.  my skin agrees with it.

i decided to give obagi a try because my friend has sworn by their products.  i was a bit skeptic because my skin is sensitive to nearly everything, but i decided to try out the 10% serum.  first night i got a bit of a tingly feeling and thought "crap, i should wash it off, i'm having a reaction" but i waited because the feeling went away rather quickly.  i don't get the tingly feeling anymore and have had zero reaction.  my skin is loving this stuff.

so, flash forward to now.  i decided to give the 20% a try. i put a few drops on my face at night and notice the results in the morning.  it's like a miracle serum.  not even kidding.  i am in love with this product! i wake up with amazingly satisfied, glowy, happy skin.  what i'm doing now is using the 10% in the morning and a few drops of the 20% at night.

4904,"i have been using this obagi 15% c serum for about 6 weeks, and i have to say i like it.  despite the warning on the package i didn't feel and tingling or discomfort when i applied it, and there is hardly any scent so i don't have to worry about it making my eyes water.

i use seven drops of the liquid and smooth it over my face, neck, and even under my eyes.  the packaging says to only apply the 5% c serum around the eyes, but ive been dabbing the 15% serum to the area around my eye socket bone without any problems.  i tried it under my eyes because i have a problem with unsightly, crepey skin under my eyes.  it is really obvious when i smile and the skin wrinkles up like wadded crepe paper.  so ive been using it for about six weeks and i have noticed that the crepey skin has improved.  it is not gone, but it is not as bad.

the only issue i have with the serum is that it reacts with some of the other creams i use.  namely the prevage serums.  if i put the prevage on top of the obagi, the prevage cream curdles and clumps up.  so i have to use the obagi in the morning and the prevage at night.  but other than that it seems an effective serum.",2017-02-17,4,3,A1YH6DMZOS59A2,B00F6XZVXC

4906,"i have used this serum for almost two weeks now and am pleased with the results. i am a fifty-something year old woman with a light completion and these are the results i have noted:

the fine lines around my eyes and mouth have lessened.
my skin feels very soft all day but not greasy.
the product does not irritate my skin which tends to be on the sensitive side of the spectrum.
my deeper forehead lines and nasolabial and marionette lines are unaffected. (yes, i had to look up what those last two lines are called.)
the product itself is thin and drippy and you have to be quick to catch and apply it or it just runs off your fingers.
i am sensitive to perfumes but this products scent does not bother me at all.

overall i really like this stuff but am not sure that i am willing to pay the current asking price for the modest results i have seen. if you are looking for a mild product to reduce your fine lines and money is not an object, i would recommend this one. if not, you might want to check out eve hansen's hyaluronic acid.",2017-02-13,4,4,A2J8289OOT5DE4,B00F6XZVXC
4907,"for a product this expensive, there are some serious qualms i have, the first being the design flaws. when i spend $70 on a product, i expect a certain quality of packaging. the label is nociably faded on the pack, which is always an indication of future problems with a product. aesthetics aside, let's get to the issue of the dropper and lid. upon opening, a lot of product spilled out. that was a bummer. i tried to use it again the next day and had a similar issue. i ended up transferring the product to a different glass bottle with a better dropper.

the second issue would be that i've been using this product for about 3/4 weeks now, and unfortunately i don't see a marked improvement in my skin. it smells really nice, and does create a nice base layer for my skincare routine, but my skin doesn't look any brighter or more plump than normal.

maybe i need to keep using it longer, though i think 4-6 weeks is a fair amount of time to determine the efficacy of a product.

with products this expensive, people really try to convince themselves that they see a difference to justify the price. if it makes you feel better to use a high end product, go for it. if you want real results, perhaps look elsewhere.",2017-02-12,3,3,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,B00F6XZVXC
4908,"i obtained obagi foaming gel at the same time as obagi nu-dern toner and serum and began to use them all at once and at the same time.  i saw incredible results after one use and this has continued since then.  my face looks years younger, cleaner and better toned.

no, this is not a paid commercial.  i am a no-nonsense new yorker, beholding to only the truth.

the foaming gel cleanses quickly, thoroughly.  it has a pleasant aroma and you only need to use a little at a time.  the toner is not very strong.  the fact that no dirt comes off is a tribute to the foaming gel.  other toners i have used are really astringents and feel like they have stripped your face of its natural oils.
the serum goes on easily and quickly.  i place a few drops in the cup of my hand and put it on my face.  honestly, i don't know what it does, but my face is smoother, with no pores showing.  my makeup goes on more easily and stays on longer.

-it basically acts as a super hydration compound with the serum successfully affecting more than just surface tissue on your face.
-dryer areas and lines see minor improvements in ways you would hope for from a product like this
-application leaves room for improvement.  serum is viscous and oily and need to be worked in with the fingers.  better for spot applications then general usage.
-no apparent smell or color.
-no irritation or discoloring.

upon application it makes my skin feel slightly oily and tacky. it doesn't absorb very quickly, i usually have to wait about 15 min to put on makeup.

the last c serum i tried smelled like burning rubber. i couldn't stand to put it on my face. this is very lightly fragranced, i can barely smell it immediately after application, which is a plus.

the problem with so much skincare is it can take months to see effects and then they might be subtle. it's hard to say now if this is product is worth it. it's not cheap.",2017-02-07,4,5,ALBW2ZBS6Z2AY,B00F6XZVXC

4914,"obagi professional-c serum comes in a small vile and it is extracted from the vile using the included medicine dropper.  the serum is not greasy and you need to use several drops on your fingers to cover your face.  it is absorbed quickly into the skin.

------ update march 20, 2017 --------------------------------------
i have been using the obagi professional-c serum 15% for over a month, but i won't use it any longer.  the reason is that the serum leaves my skin feeling dry.  i suspect it may be the alcohol that is causing the problem and it may just be that my skin is sensitive to it.  i do know that the one time that i applied the serum by placing a few drops on a finger before applying it to my face, i suddenly realized all of the cuts i had on my finger because the alcohol in the serum was painful on the cuts.  while i still like the short list of ingredients in the obagi serum, i wish that alcohol wasn't one of them.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

what i like about the obagi professional-c serum is that the list of ingredients is short.  they are propylene glycol (which is glycerin), water, l-ascorbic acid (which is vitamin c.  it is easily soluble in water and alcohol), alcohol, ascorbyl glucoside (which is a stable form of vitamin c combined with glucose), fragrance.

the mix of two forms of vitamin c is good since skin will benefit from a mix of ingredients.  l-asorbic acid is said to be able to protect skin from oxidative damages to improve the appearance of fragile skin.  however, glycerin will draw moisture from the skin itself rather than from the air if the ambient humidity is less than 65%.  many skin products will include other ingredients to stop the moisture loss from the skin, but the obagi serum does not.  as with most serums, you will want to use other products such as a face moisturizer as well to lock the moisture in.  i am also not a fan of the alcohol in the product because it will dry your skin.  i am also not a fan of the fragrance which is not powerful or unpleasant, but i would rather it not be there.

the 15% solution is said to be good for most skin types.  my skin was not irritated by it, but if you have sensitive skin, then the 10% solution would be a better choice.  the product warns not to use it near mucus membranes.

so far, i haven't seen any major changes with the use of the obagi professional-c serum, but i was already using a serum as part of my skin care regimen which then includes other moisturizers.  the obagi professional-c serum does apply quickly without any irritation and the scent does go away quickly.  because several drops are needed to cover your face, the product will be used quickly.

overall, a good serum and it is great that the list of ingredients is so short (compare this versus the cindy crawford serum, for example which has dozens of ingredients, some of which are not so good for your skin).",2017-02-04,3,3,ACHTDPEQYSEQL,B00F6XZVXC
4915,"i've been a long time user of vitamin c serum for my face and i do believe it has really helped maintain my skin and keep the fine lines away and it seems to prevent blackheads and when i do get a pimple i believe vitamin c helps them heal and clear up faster.

this is my first time with obagi, it's price has always been a bit prohibitive to me, but i will say that i am very impressed with the product. vitamin c serum can be uncomfortable to use as it does have a slight sting to it that sometimes never goes away, you just get used to it for the benefits. this obagi serum does not sting at all. it is only 10%, but i have tried 5% formulas that still had a bite to it, that this has given me no issue is fantastic. the serum is light weight and absorbs quickly into my skin and i do not seem to need to use as much as other formulas. it is a great booster for my moisturizer.

4920,"my friend had skin cancer and her doctor recommended trying the obaji skin line after a procedure and noticed great healing results... and so naturally i tried it and fell in love. the obagi professional-c serum 15% is an anti-aging serum for most skin types. it contains 15% l-ascorbic acid (vitamin c) to help naturally brighten the skin tone. the antioxidant packed serum also works to help prevent the signs of premature aging from forming on the skin, as well as treating and correcting the current signs such as fine lines and wrinkles and dark spots. i have tried other vit c products in the past and i have to say this one is now my favorite. loves: it smells great! no greasy residue. your skin feels great immediately after use. i noticed a slight difference with my fine lines after a few uses in a 10x magnifier mirror, but i have only used it for a week so i cannot report any dramatic results as of yet. con: i wish it was less expensive. if it does begin correcting my fine lines though, it will be well worth the cost. the dropper is horrible... for the price, each drop is gold... wish the design of it was better to prevent waste.",2017-01-30,5,5,A3VP3TSPGYRR65,B00F6XZVXC
4921,"i've been using vitamin c serum as part of my routine skin care for probably 10 years now and this is my first time using obagi c serum, although i have used obagi fruit acid peels.

vitamin c serum is fragile and easily degraded by light and temperature so it's best to keep this in the fridge and use it daily as it does not have a long shelf life. obagi bottles theirs in blue glass to prevent degradation from light.

i use vitamin c serum every night - particularly after needle rolling. the reason for using it at night is that vitamin c can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight. it does even skin tone when used regularly (ie: you will not see results overnight) and keeps skin soft and supple.

using the included dropper, use a few drops to smooth on clean, dry skin. i use it on my face, neck and decolletage. at first, it feels a little oily and then a little sticky but within 5 minutes, it is completely absorbed and skin feels only smooth and soft. this one is alcohol based, which i prefer because my skin tends to be oily. it has a slight fragrance added, which may be an issue for people with sensitivities. personally, i don't like the smell of this serum, or any other vitamin c serums, but the smell is gone as soon as it dries so it's not a problem for me.

this seems to be performing as well as any of the other, less expensive serums i have used over the years. it is a good quality serum. my only complaint is the price. it's not outrageous but i generally buy less expensive vitamin c serum",2017-01-30,4,4,A1FDSZISWIXH1A,B00F6XZVXC

a.) the dropper is what it should be - works perfectly because the angle at the end makes it so.

b.) the other c serums i tried were 20% and i feel that i got faster and bigger results than this 10% one. i am presuming the c percentage matters based on this experience.

c.) some c serums come with hyaluronic acid as an ingredient, and one that i tried earlier that had both c and hyaluronic acid got me the best results.

d.) the added fragrance is good, i think. normally i don't like anything with added fragrance but it's just the smallest touch and it makes me feel more confident in the product somehow. i liked it.",2017-01-29,3,5,A3NHUQ33CFH3VM,B00F6XZVXC

the obagi professional-c serum comes with a dropper that makes it easy and precise to apply the serum topically. i apply 5-7 drops to my cleansed face and neck in the evening. my nighttime moisturizer goes on next as usual. all in all, this is an excellent serum and well tolerated by my sensitive skin.",2017-01-29,5,5,AJX9A4Q19UTJU,B00F6XZVXC

4929,"in my experience, there are significant benefits of c-serum (l-ascorbic acid). it tightens the skin, helps with wrinkles, helps with psoriasis, shrinks pores, it's gentle on the skin, and adds a glow. i've noticed many of these benefits last all day (or longer), but am hoping there are long term benefits as well if used regularly.

also, the application is simple - it's not sticky, it doesn't linger. just apply and go. any residual wetness or stickiness goes away in about 5 minutes.

the big question in my mind is whether the $70 per bottle stuff is significantly better than the $10 per bottle stuff. i'm definitely sold on it, my family will be adding this serum to our daily routine. but when our bottle runs low, i will be interested to try some less expensive brands for side-by-side comparison (i will update with results).

here's what i know for sure: i don't like that obagi has added fragrance, and i don't like that it's alcohol based. but you only use a few drops (i personally use about 7 for the whole face, 2 on left cheek, 2 on right cheek, etc), so the impact of these additives is minimal.

i also know that l-ascorbic acid is unstable, if packaged cheaply, or on the shelf for a long time, or exposed to sunlight, etc etc, it will lose its potency. none of these brands are making any promises about shelf life, but something to keep in mind, especially if the product was on a shipping container from china for several months. either way, only buy c-serum in a dark glass bottle (amber, blue, etc).

i also know that vegetable glycerine has a tremendous benefits for the skin. add at night (before bed), wash off in the morning and add your c-serum, and you will double your results with minimal cost and effort.

also, l-ascorbic acid is what most people call "vitamin c", but it's not. it's only one part of vitamin c, and it's probably bad to ingest (has been tied to gallstones, heart problems, plaque in arteries). so if you're ingesting vitamins, make sure to take real ones that are sourced from food.

finally, for those who are adventurous and want to experiment (maybe on larger parts of the body), you can easily make your own c-serum with powdered l-ascorbic acid. it's very inexpensive, a whole kilogram for $15-$20. just mix with cold water and apply. but it goes bad quickly, so refrigerate, only make 1-2 days worth at a time, and toss when it turns yellow (that means it's oxidized). you can also mix with face cream.",2017-01-25,5,5,A1HOLE9R6WPT85,B00F6XZVXC

the obagi company provides precscription made formula skin products for physicians to provide for their patients, and i presume they are dermatologists. my presumption is that if a company makes products for dermatological use, these products have to pass required standards. it must be said that a skin cleanser from this company would be of high quality, and that is what i found.

4968,"vichy dermafinish corrective concealer stick, 0.16 oz gold is a very well made concealer. it goes on smoothly and rubs into the skin nicely. it has a few things about it that the buyer should be aware of.

first, the color runs a bit darker than what was expected. i would suggest going a shade lighter than you normally use and you will be fine. for me it was easy to lighten the shade by simply applying a thin layer and using a bit of white talc powder to bring it to a lighter tone. also, it is thick, apply a small amount and spread it, let it absorb into skin. if you put too much it will cake up and not look right and you will have to wipe it off and start again. apply lightly and then add more if needed. also the price on this product is a bit high compared to other very good brands available in stores. this high price is somewhat justified by the quality of the product and the less you need to use per application.

the product itself is easy to use, offered in many shades (so there is one that will surely complement your skin tone), and treats skin with care. i am allergic to just about everything ... i did not have any form of reaction to this product. for me, that says a lot about how gentle this formula is (for me).

also, i love the convenience of this very small tube. i keep this in my makeup bag in my office for the occasional mid-afternoon touch-up.

4974,"i had some reservations about this, and some uncertainty about what shade would be right.

i got lucky.  though the name of the shade deterred me, i thought that i would try it anyway.  the paler shades ought to be closer to right, i thought.  but...they weren't.  this, blended with a little bit of lighter cream concealer, worked very well for me.

i don't wear foundation.  what i do is use a primer and then concealer (to cover a sun-darkened spot, and a little red spot).  i then dust my skin with a very small amount of fine finishing powder.  i like the effect i get from doing this, and this concealer works better than others i have tried.

it should be noted, though, that i am not using this to try to lighten dark circles.  once one gets to a certain age, one has to make a choice between unlightened dark circles and concealer sitting in one's tiny under-eye wrinkles.  i opted for living with the dark circles.  i can't comment on how well this would work to lighten dark circles on a younger face.

i do wish that this make-up stayed on (and looked good while on) longer.  initially, i thought the wear-off problem was being caused by the fact that it has been very hot, and pretty much nothing looks good after hours of being out and about in such hot weather.  but it has been cooler for a few days, and the performance of the concealer was not improved.",2017-09-14,4,4,A3JV4PJZD5O4NJ,B00FW6ZTW6

this is really different to others of the kind. it is much darker than i thought i required, but i run the stick under my eyes and around my nose, pat it in with my fingertips, and then pat on foundation over it. voila! the difference is really noticeable to me. it goes on smoothly and blends perfectly. i use translucent powder to set it. i love it and would highly recommend it.",2017-09-12,5,5,A1WKQ94M45D8MG,B00FW6ZTW6

i don't have dark circles under my eyes.  i do bruise easily.  i am fortunate enough to have a maine coon cat that thinks nipping me lightly with a small amount of skin between his teeth is thanking me for treats and ice in his water disk.  not true in my brain.  so, when i don't catch him beforehand he barely holds my skin and for that, i get a bruise.  i wanted to see if this would cover that.  it does not completely but certainly hides it a good bit.

i've also used this to contour and i like it for that a lot.  it goes on smoothly; blends well with other products.  i use a makeup brush or a sponge for this and find that i like it better in thin layers.  if a product works well and does what it says it will, i guess i won't worry about the cost....i'm certainly not going to go back and check the cost and lose this one, too.",2017-09-11,4,4,A368H9GFY1JCYC,B00FW6ZTW6

i like the stick form because you can just "draw" over a blemish or something you want to conceal and then blend it in.  i initially thought this might also work for undereye circles but it is a little too firm a consistency for that.  i think it would pull on the undereye skin too much.

i don't generally wear any makeup except mascara, certainly not the stuff that clogs up a persons pores and goes all over the face.  this is nice because it blends in to normal skin tones easily.  sand worked perfectly for meas all of my slight summer color is now gone.",2015-12-13,4,5,A2503LT8PZIHAD,B00FW6ZTW6

we can all agree we're always on the search for the newest holy grail, right?

you can find me usually using elf's concealers as i have been for years. it takes me awhile to consider switching since i've had some awful results with some of the higher end products.

virchy is a brand i have not heard of before and when i received this product, i assumed it would be much more. as much as i hate the price, the product does a good job of covering up my dark circles, blending in like butter and staying on all day. of course i also put a thin layer of foundation on top and set it with a setting powder but i could go without the foundation and just set it with the powder and be fine (remember to always set with a finishing powder to help products stay on longer)!

so glad i gave this product a try. while it won't be replacing my affordable everyday elf concealer i will be keeping this around for date nights and days when i'm expecting to be photographed!",2015-11-29,4,4,ABLLHG0REGFX7,B00FW6ZTW6

 it goes on ok, i am 58 years old and if i swiped it across, under my eyes it would have pulled on my old/crepey skin as it does not glide across, but is a thicker, denser formula.

so if you have older skin, do moisturize first then definitely dabbing and blending is the way to go. i applied my foundation over it and i think it worked pretty good. the yellow/warmer than i normally would have chosen color blended right in so it looked fine. btw i used a 12x mirror attached to my window so i could see how it looked in natural daylight which is the ultimate way to test/evaluate it.",2015-11-15,4,3,A2WC9NFLG57W4H,B00FW6ZTW6

4998,"my daughter, 15 yo, and myself, old mom, got to play around with both the nude and sand colors.  it was fun.

one thing i can tell you is that neither the sand nor the nude will work for anyone with a really pale complexion.  my daughter is blessed with a peaches and cream complexion and both of these concealers looked like blushes on her.

one the other hand, i with my slightly reddish complexion did fine with both.  go figure.  i put it on my cheeks where i have a tiny broken vein and both hid it.

problems
-- when i say that the sand and nude concealer hid the tiny red line that is my broken vein i mean that if i dabbed them on that they did their job.  if i swiped them on they did not cover the spot.  you have to build up some of the slightly waxy concealer.

-- which brings up another problem that i noticed.  the moment i put a foundation on over the concealer the concealer vanished.  it would appear to have dissolved and blended too well with the foundation.

-- i also found another test subject.  one with an age spot on her hand.  i've put up two pictures with and without the concealer so you can see it at work.

-- pale skin.  i talked about it above but if you are pale neither of these concealers will look natural.  with my poor camera skills you might not be able to make out the difference, but i tried to show what they look like on my daughter.

summary
i'm actually likely to wear this without foundation.  the reason being that if i dab-dab-dabbed it on it certainly covered nicely but it didn't stay put when i tried it with foundation.

if you a pale go with something other than nude.",2015-11-14,2,3,AQ6AGWKWMTY8H,B00FW6ZTW6
4999,"i have tried many different corrective sticks. i have an autoimmune condition which has left me with several broken capillaries on my face and these type sticks have proved to be godsends. i have a light complexion with if anything, a little bit of yellow so i have to be careful about getting any foundation or cover-stick that is too dark or rosy.

this color - sand - worked great. i put just a dab on after moisturizer. the directions tell you to layer the cover stick and i don't know why i hadn't thought of that before, but it does help. personally, i have to put a little bit of a foundation (really a lightweight bb cream) on top to help blend it in.

i do recommend this. you may be able to find similar products that are cheaper but do know you are getting a nice, creamy quality cover stick if you go with this one.",2015-11-13,4,5,A2GPJR489OIH42,B00FW6ZTW6

i have very fair skin and chose 'opal.' wrong choice. i was hoping it would be like other brands' ivory - it's not. it has a darker tone and doesn't effectively blend, as a result, on my skin.

but, if price is of no consequence to you, this would be a lovely soap to have for yourself or guests.  first, it's very attractive.  the bar is basically a creamy white, with the green stripe you see.  the green having a hint of translucence.  the overall effect one of having been poured/made by hand.

the odor is delightful.  to me is was limey and 'fresh'.  for a man it might have been too strong a scent to carry from the shower, but i found that most of the scent is washed away so no one should object to using this bar --man, woman, child.

so a very nice guest soap.  it's perhaps too harsh for babies, but for grimy visitors fatigued from monument hopping in the stern summer sun... it should get them clean and possibly refreshed enough for dinner.",2014-01-30,4,4,AQ6AGWKWMTY8H,B00G2JJDGU

  la nuit de l'homme
2. spend a few days away from home, leave this bar sitting in a bathroom soap dish, when you first enter the adjoining
  bedroom  your first reaction might be,  oh, ****. that bottle of cologne must have exploded.
3. no need to turn on a diffuser or use plug- in scented air fresheners in an area of about 400 square feet from where it was placed.

the overall effectiveness and lather the baxter soap provides is very nice and i did notice a slight difference in how my skin felt (smoother) after a few days of use.  on top of that, i began to notice a strong lime smell emanating from the bathroom as the bar released a strong, but pleasant, aroma that only lasted about a week.  it was really nice to have that smell in there, but it didn't last long enough to be a selling point.

there's really not much else to say other than it was nice, but when i thought to order more the premium price tag attached made me have second thoughts and order ye olde dial body wash instead.  it's great if you're really into body cleansing and have the capitol to back up such a lifestyle but, for the rest of us, i'll stick with my usual regimen.",2014-02-20,4,3,A30IP5D5DLHRPA,B00G2JJDGU

the scent is a bit overwhelming when you first touch the package and only seems stouter when you take it out of the box, but it doesn't fill the room after you shower and move about your day. i'm kind of surprised that something that seemed so concentrated could be subtle on the body...but it is.

for a budget-minded household, the pricing may seem like a luxury, but so far the soap is very long lasting!",2014-02-04,5,5,A231LBC8EGPO5L,B00G2JJDGU
5035,"this is a big, chunky bar of soap that fits with baxter's line very nicely.  it's a little too big for me, but a good size for my husband's large hands!  the smell is gentle and not too strong, which is fine for him, although i prefer my soap a little more aggressive.  it lathers nicely and washes off clean, leaving skin feeling fresh but not tight.

i found the size to be a drawback outside of the "sized for a guy's hands" issue, which is fine - it does get a bit gooey on the bottom and since it's so big, it takes longer to dry back out.  you have to turn it over to the less gooey side every time you use it.  not a big deal.  for me, this wouldn't be a repeat purchase - but it's a good gift for a man in your life who likes a bit of pampering now and again.",2014-02-03,4,4,A2VHQDJBZH0Y7P,B00G2JJDGU
5036,"the baxter of california vitamin cleansing bar is visually impressive because of the combination of the translucent green with the opaque white. the size is large also, but not bizarrely large like some soaps from health food stores. when using it, the bar doesn't break down fast, so i can see this soap lasting a while.

the fragrance is quite interesting, being a combination of lime and pomegranate. personally, i smell more of a honeydew melon and cucumber than lime and pomegranate. however people interpret the fragrance, it's definitely a fresh, light smell. despite the melon reference, this bar is not cloying or sweet smelling.

i've read that some people were turned off by the 'overpowering' scent. i am highly sensitive to smells (i can smell everything!), and i personally found it not to be too much.

if this is your price point for facial and/or body bars, i don't think you'll be disappointed with the purchase.",2014-02-03,5,5,A1MAI0TUIM3R2X,B00G2JJDGU
5037,"moisture is the best thing about this soap, in my opinion. it leaves your skin feeling silky smooth and hydrated. many bar soaps have the opposite effect.

the scent of the 'italian lime and pomegranate' bar i received is pleasant. not overbearing, not especially feminine and not especially masculine. just fresh. there is virtually no pomegranate smell, so i would really just call it lime.

the size of the bar really is too big for the average sized hand. it slipped out of my grasp time and time again. i'm not complaining about the quantity of product, but i would have preferred they cut it in half and sold it as a two-pack at the same price. of course, after a few washings, the size of the bar does reduce and becomes more practical - but that first week was a little irritating.

overall: while this is obviously a luxuriant splurge of a soap and certainly a step above your dove or similar mass-marketed soaps, it's not better than the local soaps i've bought from whole food stores, which smell significantly better and offer a more thorough clean. personally, i would not pay the current listing price ($16.00) for another bar, but i understand that disposable money varies from person to person, so i rated it based solely on my experience with the product. it's good, above average, but not unbelievably great.",2014-02-01,4,3,AY6A8KPYCE6B0,B00G2JJDGU

the solid white bar has a translucent green stripe in the center that looks elegant in the bath. the soap is made of palm oil and a variety of botanical extracts, not of petroleum as so many soaps are. altogether, a very nice affordable luxury.",2014-02-01,5,5,A14638TGYH7GD9,B00G2JJDGU
5039,"i'm a little spoiled when it comes to soap because i haven't used commercial soap in years-- i always buy handmade soap that's loaded with moisturizing agents, rather than soap that's typically very drying. this was a good pick as far as that goes-- it's more moisturizing than other commercial brands, and it lathers well. it is a bit awkwardly large and would have been better cut in half and delivered as a two-pack, but my larger problem is with the scent. it does have a vague lime scent to it, but that's not the main scent. i really can't identify the main scent, and i'm confused about whether it's supposed to be masculine or feminine. it's not a typical sweet fruity smell like i'd expect with lime and pomegranate (which, by the way, i don't smell at all)-- it's a more unisex, garden-ish thing. not my favorite, but i'm certain that others would like it. it's just a shame there's no way to smell before you buy. maybe amazon can work that in after their drone program. ;)",2014-01-30,4,3,A5GPH59NDWJRB,B00G2JJDGU

the cleanser is nice. very gentle, and removes makeup without any irritation. the serum and night cream were a little too greasy for my skin, though. i really wanted to like them, but after using them at night my skin felt uncomfortable the next day, like a teen gushing oil. not for me, overall.",2017-08-24,3,3,A2OW1FKQFPIA5D,B00G930HW8

after using them for two weeks, i can say that these work as well as other skin regimens we've tried (mainly neutrogena and oil of olay) -- but they don't work any better to our eyes then those store-bought brands. unfortunately, the vichy products are expensive in relation to those other lines.

in short, these products work as well as those of other brands, but they're not cheap. i probably wouldn't buy vichy idealia items again unless they were more competitively priced.",2017-07-10,3,5,A7C77J4MH94B6,B00G930HW8

5047,"heavily, heavily, heavily, heavily perfumed.

if you have sensitive skin, i recommend you stay far away from this.  like most things from vichy's parent company (loreal) i found this product to be a horrible choice for my sensitive skin.  the serum wasn't nearly as offensive as the moisturizer (and i'm sincerely not sure if i reacted to the serum itself, but i can verify that is a very perfumed product, though not as strongly scented as the moisturizer).  i have combo/dry skin and sensitive skin, but i do not always react to perfumes.  this moisturizer broke me out, irritated my skin, and it irritated my eyes (without being applied near).  all this without feeling particularly moisturizing.

these are more perfumed than some perfumed body lotions i've bought.  this moisturizer should never go on a face.  my skin is slowly recovering for this experiment. regret, regret, regret.

the packaging is adorable, and it should be noted that these are trial gift with purchase type sizes.  i think the $30-ish pricepoint is fair since you have an option to try multiple products before committing to a larger size.  the products are just kinda crappy.

though i do love the lancme brand, i would  suggest that with that one exception, anyone with sensitive skin avoid any and all face products from all brands under the loreal umbrella.

the two stars were awarded because the packaging is cute and most of my rant is focused on the moisturizer itself.  i also think being able to purchase sample sizes to try or travel with is always a wonderful option for companies to offer.  even without absolutely hating the other two products, i would still never buy those again, and they are too perfumed to recommend to anyone, so i was still unable to bump this up to a third star.",2017-06-05,2,2,A2CZ98V784SRJ0,B00G930HW8

i would recommend vichy's products to anyone looking for quality skincare products without having to dig too deeply into your pockets.",2017-06-05,5,5,APPCJX62WKIIP,B00G930HW8
5049,"cleanser claims to be a 3 in 1 (cleanses, tones, removes makeup).  out of all three products in this gift tin, i like the cleanser the least.  or i guess i should say, i don't like the cleanser at all.  it does a lousy job cleaning the skin or removing make-up.  i also don't enjoy feeling like i'm washing my face with perfume.  for a product geared towards sensitive skin, what's up with the excessive fragrance?  i like&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/nxn-soft-touch-facial-cleanser-gel-to-milk-formula-natural-organic-anti-aging-for-dry-sensitive-skin/dp/b01n5farpk/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8">nxn soft touch facial cleanser, gel to milk formula, natural & organic anti-aging for dry / sensitive skin</a>&nbsp;much better.  i find it works like a charm removing all makeup including eye makeup if i massage it into my face without water first, cleaning my entire face & eyes, then rinsing off with warm water.  it smells very pleasant, gets my skin nice & clean, & is not irritating or drying.

night recovery gel-balm  is okay-ish.  it dries slightly sticky & is overly perfumed just like the cleanser.  i don't want to smell my face all night long & i don't enjoy the tacky feel.  aside from that, my skin didn't react to it.  as for any anti-aging effects, i've noticed nothing & seriously, i didn't expect to.

radiance boosting antioxidant serum.  this is my favorite product out of the three.  the only fault i have with it is... the perfume/fragrance.  vichy seems to love to make your face smell like you sprayed it with perfume.  ugh!  at least with this product, it seems to fade more quickly than the other two products.  it goes on easy & hasn't caused any irritation.  i wear it under my tinted spf moisturizer.  it is summer, so it's been enough, but if this was winter, i'd need another moisturizer on top of this before my tinted spf moisturizer.  regarding the anti-aging claims, like the night treatment, i haven't noticed anything - it has been several weeks using all three products.  well, almost.  i ran out of the perfumy cleanser pretty fast because it's just a tiny little squeeze bottle.  anyway, i didn't expect results & i didn't get them.

the packaging is nice & suitable for gift giving if the person you are buying for likes perfumy facial products.  the recovery gel & serum are in boxes that are then wrapped in tissue paper.  the bottles of these two products are glass which is nice as well.  the cleanser is in a plastic squeeze type bottle that is wrapped in tissue paper.  all three products are contained in the pretty vichy tin as pictured.

overall, this is okay.  it's really not the best product for me but i have a few older female family members who don't mind or maybe i should say are not as sensitive to all the fragrances like i am who would love to have something like this.",2017-05-30,3,3,A1RLP0R1N8H8C4,B00G930HW8
5050,"very strong fragrance. serum is nice, lightweight and a little goes long way. cream is rich, perfect for dry skin or as a night treatment.
i don't like the cleanser- not good in removing make up and it feels like a bar soap on the skin.
overall i wouldn't buy it. as for active ingredients they seems good, but there was no visible impact on my skin. i use skinceuticals, is clinicals, dr spiiller and kate somerville. pricey but they do not make my skin feel only good, they actually make a change with clinical studies behind (especially skinceuticals).
i know vichy from europe when i grew up and i liked it this brand. now i am an esthetician so i know more about skin, ingredients and importance of ph in products. my advice go to a good med spa for consultation and invest in good products. your skin will thank you.",2017-05-28,2,5,AOEUN9718KVRD,B00G930HW8

5052,"i like the vichy brand; some time ago, i got hy puret&eacute; thermale fresh cleansing gel cleanser from amazon vine, which became my go-to daily cleanser (sometimes i switch it up with other brands just because why not).it works great, and a little goes a long way - for $18 in most places, i get the 6.76oz container that easily lasts me 3 months or more.

i suppose i should have read the description better for this product, because while the set includes a full sized id&eacute;alia antioxidant serum (which i interpret as "daily moisturizer), the other products are "deluxe sample sizes" of puret&eacute; thermale 3 -in-1 cleanser and id&eacute;alia night - bizarre because i would have thought the cleanser (a product you use twice a day) would come full sized.

the tin is beautiful - but when you open it, you see three tiny boxes wrapped in tissue paper thrown inside. there is no packaging whatsoever to keep the items from bouncing all over the place in the massive tin - the tin itself is far larger than the products. i guess it should have been obvious to me again from pictures on amazon, but i would have thought it would have been secured inside and not just wrapped in tissue.

after restraining my disappointment from the massive tin vs tiny products and the "deluxe trial size" vs full sized, i tried the product - and they are fine. i use the tiniest dab of the cleanser, one pump of the "serum" and then dip the tip of my ring finger in for the night cream. i don't see that this product works better than my previous products - it works about the same.

the bonus with this set is that it makes for easy travel - and if you are buying for that reason, go for it. it is pretty pricey for a gift set in my opinion at $39 currently on amazon. i bought a travel-sized cleanser from whole foods for about $3, and then a day/night moisturizer from sheamoisture for about $12 and boom, beauty routine is done, all for well under $20.

if you want a special set for a person who travels a lot - well, maybe this would work. the products are nice, in an of themselves, even if the samples are small. i might be inclined to repurchase some of the items if i get low on them and the price is right.",2017-05-22,3,4,AQCQ5F0OJXMG9,B00G930HW8

5056,"after trying a vichy shaving foam that i really liked i ordered this vichy idealia glow essentials gift set for my wife to try.  she is always looking for facial products to make her feel more youthful, so she was very excited to give this set a try.  the gift set arrives in an attractive tin that is quite a bit larger than the products contained inside.  the three facial products are individually packaged and wrapped in some tissue paper for added protection.  my wife's first comment when she saw the product sizes, though, was that they were only samples.  i'm inclined to agree as the three products, especially the facial cleanser, are very small in size and probably won't last long at all.  that was disappointment number one.  the second disappointment was there was absolutely no information included in the tin or printed on the product boxes how to properly use them.  what little that was printed on the boxes was in several foreign languages, and it took great effort to find anything printed in english.  i was pleased to see there were some specific product directions for usage printed on amazon's web page for each individual product, so i ended up copying and printing those off for my wife to use.

there are three basic products in this gift set: a small tube of facial cleanser/toner, an antioxidant serum intended to make skin smooth and radiant, and a night cream to make skin feel well rested on awakening the next day.  vichy recommends using the facial cleanser morning & night, the antioxidant at any time during your beauty regimen, and the night cream before bed.  my wife tried the facial cleanser to remove makeup after wiping most of her makeup off with a pad.  she found that the cleanser did not remove all of her residual makeup, and she had to use it a second time to get it all off.  she has used the antioxidant and night cream as recommended but says that while her skin feels moisturized she has not noticed any other improvements in her skin.  neither she nor i can appreciate any change in the visual appearance of her skin.  overall, she was disappointed with the products and found them no more useful than what she was already using previously.

obviously, there are other reviewers who have tried the products in this gift set and really like them.  my wife clearly did not perceive much benefit from them.  they are expensive, so this gift set is probably the best way to try them out for the lowest cost to see how you like them.  they can all be purchased separately and in different sizes.",2017-05-18,3,5,ATLA5CJH0ZZHP,B00G930HW8

in my opinion, a serum is just about the most important step to facial skin care.
not only is it the base for everything else, and helpful in its own right, but it also determines how well the product in your next step that is placed on top of it is going to work.
this one goes on smoothly, allowing you to lightly decongest your face through using lymphatic techniques. just enough 'slip' before drying.
in about 2 weeks there was a slight improvement in crows feet.
my only complaint is that the top was cracked, and about a third of the serum had leaked out. in defense of vichy, i seem to have a post office where packages are flung about.

also, despite its high price tag, the box was shipped rather carelessly in a small padded envelope that didn't provide enough protection to keep the cap from being cracked and letting some of the lotion leak out. the box looked like it had been bounced about quite a bit. if you find it works for your skin, i would purchase it at a nearby drug store rather than have it shipped online.",2017-02-27,4,3,AMB2Z4FMDBWQY,B00G930HW8

this is a lightweight serum and a little goes a long way.  one pump should be enough to cover your entire face and neck.  it absorbed into my skin quickly and did not leave my face feeling at all sticky, and i was able to apply foundation make-up on top without any issues.  this serum does have a strong fragrance that dissipates once youve applied it; after a few minutes i really wasn't aware of any scent.

i wouldnt necessarily let my experience deter you from trying this product.  skin sensitivities can be pretty fickle, and just because i had a bad reaction doesnt mean that you will too.  i would suggest doing a patch test  perhaps a small spot on the side of your neck  instead of just jumping into a full application.",2017-02-22,2,5,A1XCSAX4BRT89Y,B00G930HW8

i was interested to try this because it is supposed to improve skin quality even on smoke-exposed skin and skin overexposed to uv-rays. living in southern nv i'm definitely exposed to both of those conditions. most of the restaurants in town are in casinos and it's not like they put the restaurant at the front; it's always at the very back so you have to walk all the way through the casino and supposedly be tempted by all those slot machines on the way with people smoking up a storm in the whole place (cough!). plus i swim at a membership park a few times a week and of course the pool is outside so i'm exposed to all those uv rays. add that to me being 64 and it all adds up to my skin showing age. :-(

5073,"this serum came in really attractive pink packaging that seems almost fluorescent.  the bottle is just as pretty.  it is almost a sit is trying to say that skin will be radiantly beautiful and pinkish after using this serum.  i was not familiar with lr2412 ingredient so i did some research.  as it turns out there is a new product from lancme called visionnaire that contains 4% of lr2412.  i found an article about this ingredient and here is what it says:
so, what is lancomes lr 2412 ingredient (allegedly being used at a 4% concentration and now followed by a "cx" designation)? lr 2412 is derived from the jasmine plant. lancome maintains that this ingredient is a molecule designed to propel through skin layers. as it does so, it triggers a cascading series of micro-transformations. sounds like a magic wand for your skin, doesnt it? and lancomes constant reminder that this ingredient is protected by 20 patents makes it seem even more remarkablebut a patent has nothing to do with efficacy; it is only about a unique way to use any ingredient. a patent can be obtained simply by presenting an idea, not proof that the idea actually works.

as it turns out, simply propelling an ingredient through skin is not a guarantee of anything beneficial happening, and it may even make matters worse. for example, many ingredients, such as sunscreen actives, are meant for and should stay on the skins surface; you don't want them to penetrate through multiple layers of skin because they need to protect the skins surface. also, lots of ingredients can propel through skin and cause beneficial changes along the way, such as most antioxidants, glycerin, sodium hyaluronate, ceramides, retinol, and numerous other repairing ingredients whose daily use helps improve skins appearance and healthy functioning. in essence, lancomes claim makes lr 2412 sound innovative, when its really nothing new or all that exciting. but the ballyhoo sure makes it tempting!

on the ingredient list for visionnaire, lr 2412 is listed as sodium tetrahydrojasmonate, which, as mentioned, is derived from the jasmine plant. part of the original formula but now gone is another part of the jasmine plant, tetrahydrojasmonic acid. both of these ingredients, in their natural state, are lipids (fats) that help the jasmine plant signal when repair is needed and that control the life cycle of the plants cells (sources: plant physiology, april 2010, pages 19401950; and plos biology, september 2008, page e320).

lancome wants you to believe that these lipids, which in the jasmine plant repair environmental damage and control cell behavior, can somehow have similar effects on your skin, such as improving wrinkles, reducing large pores, and fading red marks when applied to skin via their bioengineered lr 2412 molecule. unfortunately, there isn't a shred of published research to support their assertion. more to the point, even if these jasmine-derived ingredients were miracle workers for wrinkles, large pores, and red marks from acne, the amount of alcohol in the formula (it's the fourth ingredient) likely will harm your skin in the process, so any potential benefit is muted.

lha another important ingredient in this product stands for lipo hydroxyl acid, which it turns out is a derivative for salicylic acid.  as someone who has combination skin, this is perfect ingredient for my skin. apparently, according to another article, lha is 6x more potent than salicylic acid.",2015-11-10,3,2,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B00G930HW8

the formula features a behavioral molecule formulation that supposedly boosts the skins natural rejuvenation process. it also has a micro-exfoliator to stimulate skin renewal. these are the claims on the label, but im not familiar with these particular ingredients.

i tried it for eight days and definitely noticed a difference in how my face looked. it definitely looked more hydrated and youthful. however, its not like it took ten years off or anything. but, i believe it does work to make the face look fresher and rejuvenated.

its a lighter, creamy texture and doesnt feel greasy. it smells like roses. the smell is not too overpowering, which is good. i don't want anything too smelly, even if it does smell nice (like this).

my main issue with this product (and most higher end serums in general) is the price. its way too high for an ounce of liquid. i highly doubt the ingredients are that costly.

what i can tell you is
positives: the pump..i love products that come with a pump so that i don't have to stick my fingers into the jar.
  the texture..it is a light creamy texture not greasy or sticky
  the scent.. it smells a little rosey, but is not overwhelming which is always a positive for me since i have allergies.
  the look... the color is pearlescent and while others do not seem to notice it, i can see it on my darker skin
  also a little goes a long way
negative:  it bothers me that there weren't any directions in the package, but i went online to look up how to use it.
  on one occasion it burned a little, but i can't remember what i had done as far as washing my face etc.
  sometimes it peels

review update: 11/8/15

so i decided to give this one another try because i think that the negative experience i had before was due to me using other products at the same time. sure enough, my skin didn't show any signs of irritation and felt much softer after using it for about 2 weeks. the smell is actually pleasant, not sweet,  just a soft clean smell. i use it at night and it works quite nicely in conjunction with my moisturizer.",2015-11-02,4,3,ATJ22NADXNLD9,B00G930HW8

i expected to like this product the least of everything i've tried from dermablend since my skin naturally leans a bit more dry and i've always thought of dry skin and powder foundation as being less than ideal.  but actually, i quite like this.  of all the products i've found this one is the easiest to vary the coverage.  with a brush i can get lighter coverage for daytime wear or switch to a sponge for more coverage.

i am attempting to switch from bare escentuals, a product i have used for years, because it no longer offers the amount of coverage i need. i chose a medium shade of dermablend intense powder foundation makeup because it claimed to have greater coverage without the heavy feeling of liquid makeup. medium is the shade i wear in most makeups, so i figured this would be similar to those. when i received the product and opened it, i knew immediately that this medium was not going to work for me. i tried it on and realized that it is far darker than i expected, with an unattractive orange tint to it. i did put the makeup on to see how it covered in case i wanted to try a different shade. it does offer fairly good coverage, covering my acne scars well without leaving a cakey, heavy feeling behind. while i usually forgot that i was wearing makeup with bare escentuals, this make up is a little heavier, but i guess that is the sacrifice i need to make in order to have better coverage. i have not yet purchased a different shade to see if it matches my skin color better.",2017-08-22,4,3,A34109J1GZMHY1,B00H2VO6P0
5118,"since i have extremely sensitive skin and eczema, i can't wear make-up every day... i only wear make-up on special occasions, such as weddings, interviews, photo shoots, etc.

one of my biggest challenge when it comes to wearing foundation is my dry skin flaking and peeling as soon as my liquid foundation dries after application. i am giving this product a four star rating because i still see some dryness on my face, and the coverage is more medium than full, unless i really cover up with layers and layers of foundation (i use the sponge that came with it). overall, i think it applied better than my other foundations, but not by very much. it is definitely matte - maybe i should look for a more dewy foundation.

the direction says if i want a more dewy look, pat some water on my face with the sponge afterwards. that wasn't very helpful on my face. once the water dries, it looks dry still. regardless, it was easy to apply.

about mid-way through the day, i noticed that my face was getting a bit pink - the beginning of irritation. my face was feeling tingly as well, but it wasn't a full-blown irritation. i've skin-tested this a few days before applying on my face, and i was fine, so this could have been the heat of the day or that my face simply doesn't like to be covered in foundation.

hopefully my before/after photos help you see how it worked on my face. i tried to take it under the same light but i think the before photo still turned out a bit darker. you can use my lips as gauge - i did not put any lipstick on in both photos.",2017-08-12,4,5,AFDJGY68CQL2X,B00H2VO6P0

so, foremost, you might want to start with light primer (first go very light and, if needed, add more the next time. this will prevent the powder from clumping, rolling, or caking). i tried two different bare mineral primers, but they were not as compatible with this product as shiseido refining makeup primer. by using a light primer, your pores will not appear as noticeable (and it should give a more blurred, diffuse appearance).  if possible, approach this with a light touch ... instead of a sponge (unless truly needed for extensive coverage), use a brush to incrementally dust on more and more product (as needed). build very slowly so as to avoid a cake-y/unnatural appearance. (this should not happen if you go very slowly).

this product is nice on normal to oil skin. dry skin could look dryer and scaly. so do be careful here. exfoliate, hydrate, and prime, before trying this on dry skin ... this can actually work really nicely. and this applies to a like products ... i've had similar issues with the loose and compact bare minerals powders. so, it's not a fault with dermablend, it's just kind of inherent in this type of foundation.

using this powder well does take a lot of finesse. so, practice with this first. nonetheless, once you learn how to use this, it is an effective product.",2017-07-27,4,5,A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M,B00H2VO6P0

5149,"i was very pleasantly surprised by this powder foundation. i was afraid that it would look artificial, clog my pores, and cause breakouts, but it doesn't. it goes on easily with my large brush and blends wonderfully, covering as much as i want. it's a nice, matte finish that lasts as long as i want it to and it removes quite easily when i'm ready.

the powder is durable too, even though it dislodges easily with a light rub of my brush. i accidentally dropped it on our tile floor and it suffered no cracking or damage.

it's a bit pricey, but not terribly so, and i feel that the quality is worth it.  i've been using it for about a month now.",2017-07-16,5,5,A26BU3ZU0R5IPF,B00H2VO6P0

usually i use a clear gel primer, then a liquid foundation, and i will follow up with this to set it all. it really helps make the liquid blend in and controls a little bit of the shine... so makes it a bit more matte.  i suggest using a kabuki makeup brush... it's perfect for that.  i love that with a compacted foundation, you can easily control how much you want to use.  just a little swirl with your brush and you can lightly touch up (and if you have oily skin or combination skin, you will need to do this on your forehead a couple times over the day!); but if you keep swirling you slowly get more on your brush and you can use quite a bit if you are in a rush and want to skip your liquid foundation step.

5174,"this is not my favorite powder. first, the both of the colors are really quite orange, so unless your skin is on the oompa loompa spectrum, it might not be great. but, and this sort of contradicts what is says about "medium to full coverage", it is relatively sheer, so when you put it on, it looks like a light spray tan (yes, the orange kind, but not in a terrible way, just in a kind of unnatural way).

if you are in the heat or sweating, you can also expect it to look patchy if used alone. some parts will look shiny, some won't. some will keep the color, some will kind of soak into your pores, making your face feel like it's suffocating a little. i was outdoors for not very long but in florida heat, and it should have done better for fewer than 10 minutes. i would strongly hesitate using it for all-day wear or for performing (i'm a dancer, so i need makeup that holds).

in short:
-coverage is semi-sheer to medium, not full (unless you apply some sort of base)
-color is quite orange tinted
-feels heavy on skin and in pores

not the worst, not the best. i wouldn't recommend it when others cost less and are better.",2017-07-09,3,3,A35HOUWHAYZZN6,B00H2VO6P0

i have tried numerous dermablend products in the past, and sometimes the shade in person appears much darker to me than the product image. in this case, with bronze, i was pleasantly surprised at how well this powder blended in.  at first i was afraid it too was going to be too dark as some others have been, but it worked really well, almost to the point i couldn't tell i was wearing makeup.  it is definitely light weight and provides a nice base for the rest of my makeup. this is definitely my favorite shade of the ones i have tried.",2017-07-09,5,5,A39H1GO9E3YQIB,B00H2VO6P0

the second application i did with a wet sponge. wow. super full coverage. i looked almost flawless. it was very smooth and lightweight. while it's not transfer proof, it is definitely resistant to transfer. i rubbed my face and barely got any transfer onto my fingers.

i have never before tried powder foundation  mostly because i didn't think it would stay put or would cover very much. i was pleasantly surprised by the intense powder camo. it comes with a round sponge, which has its own compartment in the bottom of the compact but i just keep it stashed on top of the powder itself. i tried the 35w toast and the 50w honey, both of which are in the warm class; however, the honey was too dark for me. toast is just right.

according to the instructions, for medium coverage, apply with a powder brush. for full coverage, apply with the sponge. i prefer the sponge because it seems to get more product on my skin. i like to pat all over my face and then blend a little with the sponge. it is buildable; if you aren't satisfied with the coverage of any discoloration or acne or scars, just keep patting more product on until it fully conceals. but do not forget to blend so that the powder looks even. the powder is dense and does stay put, especially if you finish your makeup off with the setting spray.

although it works well with uneven skin tones, acne and scars, i found that it didn't really fill in large pores nor do a satisfactory job with dark undereye areas. even with a primer, my large pores still showed up. as for the undereye, i had to use a cream concealer to do the job. for that i recommend using the dermablend blurring mousse camo.",2017-07-04,5,4,A19RDMX22VXXSD,B00H2VO6P0

i have been using loreal products since the 1980s when my best friend was wearing a frosted lipstick i liked and i later sought out.  it smelled good too. it was a truer color in my eyes, since many comparable brands were putting red tinges into the light pinks and such.  also, some of the loreal colors of lipsticks and eyeshadows were pearly, and i liked them because they looked very ethereal, as with the pink-violet lipstick that changed colors depending on the light.

i have aged, and my last purchase was a loreal infallible product, one of many in a line which rarely or never need reapplication for my creased lids and bitten lips. i have been so obsessed that i have a whole zipper case full of the eyeshadows alone. i have a lot of products from their visible lift line for my skin texture. i especially enjoyed the blur ones.  now i am going to move on to have more choices in my zip bag.

there has been more exposure with loreal in my experience than i can mention here, including most recently, a lovely reddish-brown shade of eyeshadow that stays put, a super-mascara, another lip paint, some face-tone enhancers, and a creamy-to-dry, light-colored eye light, among others.

i am happy to see more high-end products from loreal that should work well for young and old alike, especially since it seemed to me years ago that their products were for my younger crowd.

1. dermablend professional cover cr&egrave;me with titanium dioxide sunscreen (30spf):
this is the first item in this line of dermablend cosmetics from loreal that ive received, and it is my very favorite.  it covers my skin imperfections well.

my first attempt with it doesnt count, since i spread it very thin, allowing a bit of dermatitis i had at the time to show some dry skin through.  and i went out that night wondering why this was happening.  first of all, i thought i needed to get rid of the rash that was there before reapplying and reviewing this product, and second, i thought i needed to exfoliate since i have sun spots. now i get it.  this particular cr&egrave;me has to be built up gradually for me. and building it up judiciously is not problematic at all.  it is lovely.

if i use a sponge applicator it will ruin one purpose of it for me which is to cover variable imperfections; and when i apply it with dab it appears blended, and i really find out how radiant and thorough a cover cream make-up can be.  it has alone a bit of chroma to it, as does dermablend pro smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation (25 spf),  in my opinion, unlike many other cover products i have used. alone, they gleaming the light more than my other cover make-ups, without chalkiness.  very nice.

the other purpose for me is that it has a (30 spf) sunscreen.  all other cosmetics with sunscreen i have tried have (25 spf) or lower, and not my needed (30 spf) that my dermatologist recommends.  she has said that even in my home with shades closed i am exposing my skin to potential damage.  i score 1,000 % here for this as well as the other qualities of this line.

the two colors i have are both medium ones, one a bit lighter, and both appropriate for me, especially my indulgence of mixing other lighter or darker colored loreal dermablend pro products with them.

ive been feeling a bit like a chemist with the many loreal dermablend pro products listed here. and i realize you may not have this type of a menu, but i am hoping this info will help somehow to see the flexibility here if not anything else.

2. loreal dermablend professional translucent loose setting powder (no spf):
needed. the wonderful cr&egrave;mes i love work nicely with loreal dermablend professional translucent loose setting powder with micronized powder, and hides flaws when that is part of what you are going for.  this particular product is very fine, not grainy, and perhaps a bit creamy.  it definitely blends in well.  it is very nice for creating a thin and matte next barrier, keeping the cr&egrave;me, bases, foundations, from smudging to hands, clothing.  in various ways, i am able to get some creative looks i sought in using them together:

 dermablend pro translucent loose setting powder in my three separate medium shades (separate jars); when applied and then dusted off created light on dark or dark on light look as i so chose. a. what i mean is that with the lighter shade of cr&egrave;me i was able to get the same look with the darker powder, as with the opposite of that technique using the darker cr&egrave;me and a lighter powder. altogether, with these medium shades i was able to get a perfect match, thus prolonging my experience.  b. also, with the white translucent powder i have found that i am getting a more dimensional look by applying the light shade powder on certain areas of my face, and on top or around in certain areas like cheeks, nose, chin, forehead, i will carefully apply and lightly dust the medium-toned translucent powders as described, allowing it to not look quite so much like monotone matte over my sallow complexion.  another plus 1,000 for me.

i have found recently that i need to put on fine dustings of all powders for myself.
pick your poison, as i have purchased some powder and cr&egrave;me blushes before today; though you may find it unnecessary if you want the dimensional yet minimalist look.

i like to play with the powders, yet, when i am in a rush i will make errors, not being subtle, and not dusting before other products.  also, i am 62, and my baggy under-eye application errors are the most noticeable. i get rid of this bagginess first.  i will use the powders now, especially with other lighter dermablend cr&egrave;me applications, or with the high-quality dermablend pro smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation (25 spf) listed below; and as well as their other foundations. all definitely for photos where a shine or two really counts.
one thing that helps give a nice touch over the powders and such is the loreal dermablend professional set + refresh long-lasting make-up setting spray. the powders are probably quite wonderful for an oily skin type, for example; they are nice for a youthful complexion; and i believe they are going to look quite radiant on a woman with less-noticeable pores, and without wrinkle issues along with age and skin texture combined.  in my case i am fine, and safest when i am well-rested.

3. loreal dermablend professional set + refresh long-lasting make-up setting spray (no spf):
these dermablend base products are synergistically enhanced with a nice sheen of fresh with a spray application of loreal dermablend professional set + refresh long-lasting make-up setting spray. just lightly mist your face with your hair pulled back to enhance your look and seal your make-up applications.  even with dusted powders it will make a difference.  it is that simple.

4. loreal dermablend professional smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation!! (25 spf):
this a product that i had underestimated until today when i applied it under dermablend pro translucent loose setting powder, which may not be necessary if you want that chroma look; yet because i preferred the variable built-up applications i achieved with the dermablend professional cr&egrave;me, i missed something with trying this last.  as before i was too quick to judge.  i had applied it very thick and then i went out.  i thought to myself that is was mask-like, yet nice moist cover.

not only can i variably apply this creamier product to cover the face and problem areas with my fingers, i can also use a sponge blender for a more airbrushed look, then applying more product to the flaws. this shade is a tad darker than the other shades of make-ups, so as with the cr&egrave;me, and the powders, i may experiment with altering the look as in 2a.  win-win-win.  i also may add a finishing touch of the dermablend professional set + refresh long-lasting make-up setting spray for a fresh stay; with or without powders.

5. loreal dermablend professional intense powdercamo!! (no spf):
this is a lovely and creamy intense powder in a nice mirrored compact with a sponge applicator, in other compartments.  while this color is quite dark for me, one quality, besides the products ability to render a thin cover layer, is that i do not see wrinkles really.  maybe the thin layer or the creaminess?  and the staying power, especially with the fresh mist of loreal dermablend professional set + refresh long-lasting make-up setting spray.  also, i can dab and smooth this powder wherever i want to whatever area of the face or neck.  the darker color, applied gently is making a nice bronzer.  i do know that is stretching it. i haven't tried it over the above loreal dermablend professional liquid camo product, since this is a very dark color; however, i am sure this might possibly work; though this does go on thin, and i do not think a cr&egrave;me or foundation is needed to get a good look. very nice camo cover product!

6. loreal dermablend professional quick-fix body!! (no spf):
wow again.  i hadnt understood at first how i can use this, as one of the colors i own is a darker bronze; and while i hadnt yet noticed the medium (my shade).  i mistakenly applied some of the dark under my cheekbones to see a defined look which actually worked for me, yet thick as i applied it - and silly me! i am thinking that since this product says body in the title it is going to be nice for use on varicose veins and other body imperfections like a permanent rash i have!  double win!

this is a creamy roll-up stick cover product which does the job, and which i won't feel shy about adding puffs of dermablend professional translucent setting powder so it doesnt rub off; and i will use the appropriate color powder as well as described above in 2a.  this is a lovely product.  i love the idea of having a smooth body-skin look as with the generous tube of the wonderful, and long-lasting dermablend professional leg and body make-up; however, im mentioning this first as im partial to a more natural, yet youthful, less unsightly look.  it isn't quite going to be looking as flawlessly airbrushed as the full body make-up, yet it is the product i will use first; especially during the day. love.

7. loreal dermablend professional leg and body make-up (spf25):
it is so nice to wear tights, stockings, or nylons during the winter to have confidence that leg imperfections will not be seen with dresses, and on ankles under pants above boots.  however, during cooler months especially, it is very nice to see perfect body skin peeking out of your clothing.  not only does this product render a flawless airbrushed look, it is actually very resistant to liquid or rubbing off onto hands or clothing.  i absolutely loved the look when i put it on; and then darn, i was noticing in the light that my shade was a bit peachier than my actual sallow skin.  this might not be problematic for you with full-body applications, as for me on an occasional basis as desired; yet finding your closest match will save you a lot of bother, and will please you i believe.  as i have expressed that this product renders a nice, airbrushed look, and i believe even because of the staying power alone this dermablend pro product is worth looking into.

8. loreal dermablend quick-fix concealer stick (spf 30)
this works fabulously; it is creamy and it stays put; it is smart just as the loreal dermablend professional cover cr&egrave;me, because it has that strength of sunscreen that my dermatologist recommends, even as i am in my home, shades drawn.  it covers very well, looks flawless with or without other products, yet it works synergistically with the wonderful loreal dermablend pro line. i have it in a tan color, and i would have thought since i usually use lighter shades of concealers that it would not have looked so perfect with my medium skin. lovely. plus 1,000, and very smart.

very nice products indeed.  enjoy!

5200,"dermablend makeup has been around for a long time, and i have tried various forms of their makeup over the years.

whether it's from blemishes, or discolorations due to broken blood vessels or various other ailments or just natural aging, their makeup has long been regarded as the best  to coverup and conceal. the price for that however is that they also can feel heavier than many other makeups.

saying that, this dermablend intense powder camo makeup is no exception. i really like it a lot, and it's great to use after you put on a concealer or just by itself. it's just that as you get older, watch out that although these powders can cover discolorations,  they can also make us look older.

the biggest problem with buying makeup online is that you really need to try them on in person, in the right light to get the right shade. i hate to see negative reviews when the problem is that the person just bought the wrong shade. and it's really almost impossible to get the right shade online.

saying that, i am light-skinned with dark hair and i would describe my skin as being more olive toned. i am reviewing this powder in sand 30n and the color is just a bit too dark for me- almost what i would look like if i had a tan. but the powder itself is really nice albeit a teeny bit heavier than some of the other brands i have used.

still, recommended in the right shade.",2017-07-03,4,4,A2GPJR489OIH42,B00H2VO6P0

5206,"i have been loving the dermablend products i've tried and this is no exception.  i suffer from rosacea and it takes good coverage to make my skin a uniform color.  i also had not imagined a powder foundation would cover the redness on my face but this is highly pigmented and does the job beautifully.

this has a medium coverage and yet gets rid of serious redness.  i don't think it would cover more severe skin imperfections but for my rosacea it's perfect.  and it looks very natural.  my face looks flawless with this.

i apply this with a large brush and in the areas of the most redness i layer on another two coats and all redness vanishes.  this also eliminates the undereye circles i get without settling into wrinkles.  it also erased the appearance of the large pores on my nose.

i prefer this to liquid or creme makeup since it's summer and i dislike coating my face with heavier foundations to get the coverage i need.

i tried applying this both ways it suggests, dabbing and building it up with a sponge, then as a setting powder with a brush. i like using it as a final step with the brush because i felt it looked more natural. i do not like my makeup to look or feel heavy and building it up kind of gave that look. too powdery. this gets rid of any shine i have, typically this happens around my nose.

5215,"this powder foundation provides excellent coverage and is super easy to apply. it sure beats all the fuss of other types of foundation (needing powder to set and additional concealer). i had some difficulty getting it to look smooth on dry areas of my skin. after playing around with this product for a few days i hit upon some success in using it. it's necessary to do some very good exfoliation and wear hydrating serum and moisturizer underneath this product. using a primer can help as well. i typically don't use powder foundations because they can be a bit drying on my skin and make wrinkles and lines more apparent. but i wanted to try this one because i love dermablend products (have used them professionally as a makeup artist) and am seeking a way to block out the sun's rays since i'm a retin a user. liquid foundation simply melts on my face in the summer! i feel that this is a much better foundation than say, lancome's well known product, it has excellent coverage and looks natural (i use a lot less concealer!) yet the skin must be prepped to remove any dry patchy areas, and a very hydrating moisturizer used to prevent dryness or "cracking". very young skin, oily or normal skin most likely won't have these issues. if your skin is dry naturally, or you're like me and use retin a (retinol, aha and bha acid based products) be aware that it may be a challenge to get this product to look perfect on your skin. you also ust use a proper applicator (right kind of sponge, like a beauty blender) as well.",2017-06-30,4,5,A2GA64WZK8PKBC,B00H2VO6P0

5221,"dermablend professional intensepowder camo medium buildable to high coverage cocoa is slightly darker than the medium beige-like olive, but it has an interesting application for concealing & neutralizing makeup not by hiding blemishes and discoloration in order to achieve an almost perfectly uniform appearance, which is extremely rare and thus uncommon, but by greatly reducing their intensity to make them appearing like a natural only slight variation of color typical to the rest and vast majority of us additionally intensifying with aging.  it is especially useful to cover darker and more reddish blemishes and discoloration, so the resulting hue, which is a product of making cocoa slightly more reddish, becomes a typical natural variant.  in other words, of 2 methods: (1) to choose a color matching the complexion to cover entirely the discolorations, or (2) to choose the cocoa color and to cover the discolorations with a thinner layer showing slightly trough, the second is much cheaper, as using much less creme, and does not produce artificial, mask-like effect, but requires more artist-like skills.",2017-06-28,4,4,A3FOSLM5G1BO63,B00H2VO6P0

5224,"the dermablend intense powder camo medium to full coverage foundation makeup with matte finish is amazing!  it comes in very a nice compact. the top part of the compact has a mirror,  the middle section homes the powder, and beneath the powder is a compartment for an included blender sponge. the compact is secure and i don't feel it would ever just come open in my purse, bag, or suitcase when brought along.

my skin is oily and sometimes has undesired redness and blemishes. this powder makeup has helped my skin have the desired look i want to achieve when wearing makes up. i simply apply with my own makeup brush, blend with the included blender sponge, tap here and there to build up coverage, and set with a spray to prevent it wearing off or smudging.  if i am going to take the time to apply makeup, i like it last so i really feel a finisher spray is really important. i mainly wear makeup for church, date nights, or other important events like photo shoots or fancier get-togethers and parties.

i like this makeup is fragrance-free, allergy-tested, sensitive skin tested, non-comedogenic. the company gives advice in how to reach the desired look with this powder. looks one can achieve are sheer coverage, maximum coverage, matte finish, or a dewy finish. if needing help to create these looks there are plenty of videos online if a visual helps better than written instructions.

with this makeup, i can achieve the smooth natural finish i so desire. i'm a simple girl and i like to maintain a natural look. i feel this makeup helps me to accentuate my natural beauty perfectly. i don't look overly shiny. my skin doesn't feel clogged. there's absolutely no cakey or masky look when this is applied.  the makeup lasts all day long and the quantity and quality is well worth the pricing.",2017-06-28,5,5,A194K60CWZ371J,B00H2VO6P0

the great thing about this powder is that it fills in my giant pores and the weird hole that appeared on my nose the last 10 months or so.  it really does a great job and lasts all day.

it is not heavy at all, i thought it would be, coming from dermablend, but no, very silky and very nice.  i use it every day, including on my eyelids and lips as a base.

(also, it gets everywhere, so be mindful of that before you use your brush!)  the color was just a bit darker than anticipated, but nothing drastic.  this did feel a little heavier than some other powders, but this is expected with this level of coverage.  all in all, this is a great product for the price, especially if you have sun spots or redness.  reasonable price, too.",2017-06-27,4,5,AAZ5OJ2OOJ2DK,B00H2VO6P0

skin powder diffuses light so your face is not so shiny. i don't care about shiny skin except when it comes to photos and selfies, and then powder makes a big difference in how the picture comes out. without powder, my face looks weird in pictures. if you are going somewhere and you think someone is going to take your picture, be sure to put on some powder.

the powder is very good for covering imperfections, when needed. i've got age spots and redness so believe me - i need this powder in the event i need to make a presentation in public. it gives me a bit of confidence knowing that the audience is focusing more on what i have to say; and less on the imperfections of my aging skin.

5244,"i'm pretty satisfied with this powder foundation. i have combination skin, and mostly want to cover unevenness, with an occasional blemish or sunspot. this offers buildable coverage with a matte finish. i apply with a large brush like powder, but it does have the coverage of light foundation. when applied with the included sponge, the coverage is heavier.

it's summer in the southern us (hot and humid) and i wear a light moisturizer with spf under my makeup, so nothing's going to keep my face shine-free all day. however, this wears well over moisturizer or sunscreen, and mattifies as well as anything.

i didn't lower my rating for this, but my biggest issue is selecting the right shade. i generally need a "light" shade of makeup (darker than "fair" but lighter than "medium",) with neutral to cool undertones, and i currently have a light tan. the good news is that i guessed suntan 30c would work for me, and it does. i don't know whether it's the best dermablend shade for me, but at least close enough. however, the info on amazon seems to suggest it's a "medium" shade, and i guessed the "c" to mean cool. but the "find your shade" feature on the dermablend website seems to indicate "suntan" is a light, warm shade - and that seems to be more accurate. if anything, i do think it's on the yellow side for me. i seem to have lucked into at least a close enough shade, but i suggest checking into dermablend's site for help with color selection.",2017-06-25,4,4,A1QT3N5FUQ4I47,B00H2VO6P0

it's unscented, which is good.  not greasy or oily.  it's heavy and doesn't seem like it breathes all that well.

based on description and reviews  and cost  both my daughter and i expected the dermablend intense powdercamo would do a better job of hiding our flaws than our usual makeups.  however, we both found this not to be the case, whether used by itself or with a liquid foundation.

obviously, skin types and imperfections vary by individual, and some people may find this product to be a good makeup for them to use.  however, based on its price and my personal results, as well as my daughters, i would not buy it myself.",2017-06-25,2,3,APPJNVNF4BFLB,B00H2VO6P0

i have very sensitive skin and find that in general powder foundations don't make me break out as much as liquid or creme foundations do.  that holds true with this powder foundation.  i didn't have any breakouts while using it.

this doesn't color correct quite as well as the pixi colour correcting powder foundation and it has a more glowy look to it than the pixi foundation.  so i found that it didn't cover the redness in my nose area quite as much as i would have liked.  it also isn't as matte as the pixi foundation, but i think this will make it better for dryer skin.  it has decent staying power, i didn't notice it rubbing off or creasing.

overall i ended up liking it a lot and plan on using it up, especially on days where i want a more natural and less matte look.  however, i still like my pixi colour correcting powder foundation better because it provides a bit more coverage, has better color correcting and gives a more matte look.  i would recommend to those with sensitive skin who are looking for a good medium coverage powder foundation, this is a good one.",2017-06-25,4,4,A22B13EJTZKCTM,B00H2VO6P0

5271,"update~
this has become my go-to purse compact.
gives powder touch up without cake. its like a very light liquid in powder form, if that makes sense.

the mirror is a good quality & size to check yourself or touch up.
however, the makeup & sponge are fantastic on top of other make up without caking and,
this works great on its own when i'm running out the door but don't want to bother with a full face.
gives medium coverage with a light blur, absorbs sweat & oil.
this is my fave grab & go dermablend.

original review~
i've been experimenting with the dermablend line trying to find that famous dermablend coverage, while letting my skin shine through.

also, i work outside in a year round warm climate so i need a make up that will survive sweat & not run on my clothes.

i love that they have great products that last & are made with a high spf that hasn't burned my eyes or bothered my face.

i really felt creams, for my coverage,
 were my only option.
i ordered this bc i needed a contour powder.

oh. my. word.
this "powder" is amazing.

first, the most beautiful, large compact with a mirror and a sponge that works!!

it glided onto my skin like silk & finished like suede. it's almost creamy but in a powder.
i don't even know a better way to describe bc there is nothing i've tried like it.
wow.

also, the suntan is much lighter than i expected, even after checking out the dermablend website.
it was a bit tan when i first applied then melted to match my caucasian with a light tan skin.

finished with dermablend setting spray, (my new goto staple), & voila! magic!",2017-06-21,5,3,A1SM0G50FP7XKJ,B00H2VO6P0
5272,"after some trial and error with the application, i was actually pleased with this product. the color for one was absolutely perfect for my skin tone. it couldn't be any more spot on. i wouldn't necessarily say that it provided me with "full" coverage, but i personally don't rely on powder foundations to cover anything up (i use liquid for that). i much prefer using powder as a final layer over my face to achieve more of a mattified look. i typically use base minerals to achieve this, but the dermablend intense powder offers similar results that help diminish shine on my oily/combination skin

i do have to note that i personally use a kabuki brush with this powder and feel that it's the best option for anyone who is looking to apply this dry. i initially tried using the sponge that was included in the compact. this left my the makeup looking terribly cakey. if you end up putting too much of this on, it will easily highlight imperfections and fine lines. using a brush allows me to lightly sweep a little on a time, so i don't overdo it.",2017-06-21,4,5,AZQKNX6F8S84Q,B00H2VO6P0
5273,"this is a nice light powder that is fragrance free.  however it transfers easily and in my opinion needs to be reapplied occasionally if you want to have that shine-free finished look to last all day long.  it helps to even out uneven skin tones and blotches, but when it comes to blemishes or dry patches they seem to stand out more since the powder sits in the cracks and crevices which makes them look more obvious.  the powder is silky smooth and soft to the touch with a matte finish.

works great to control shine, uneven tones and blotches,  but i prefer to use cream concealer for blemishes and scars.",2017-06-21,4,3,A3AYSYSLHU26U9,B00H2VO6P0
5274,"the dermablend intense powder camo is an excellent quality powder foundation. it gives what i would call light to medium coverage depending on how it is applied. instructions say to apply with a dry sponge (included) for medium coverage and a damp sponge for full coverage. i prefer using a damp sponge and was able to get good but not really "full" coverage.
the compact includes a sponge and mirror and is very nice quality.
it is perfect for toting around in a purse or when traveling.
the "nude" shade is a good neutral - no hints of yellow or pink undertones.
while i prefer a cream foundation during the drier winter months, this powder foundation is perfect for the hot and humid mid-atlantic summers.",2017-06-20,4,5,A2R95Z7PTF5ZRO,B00H2VO6P0
5275,"i usually use cream foundations, but i thought i'd give this a try because it sounded easy to apply. i'm not crazy about it.

first, it was cracked when it arrived (see photos).

second, i found it difficult to apply evenly and thickly enough with the very thin sponge applicator. i followed the instructions and applied it with the damp sponge. it took much longer to "build" than my cream foundation and it didn't go on smoothly or evenly. it felt splotchy and uneven. at the end of the day, when i used a makeup removing cloth to remove it, there was no color left! so, obviously it did not stay on my face. i will probably use the rest as a powder after applying cream foundation. i think it will work well for that.",2017-06-20,3,3,A4SD8F79JBYG2,B00H2VO6P0
5276,"i am picky about my makeup. for reference, i am caucasian with a medium skintone. i have combination skin that is oily, but dry in certain spots. i also have uneven skin with a lot of red in it. my go to is a full coverage cc cream. however, i am always looking for a better or different alternative. i am happy to say that this powder can not only substitute in for my normal cc cream, but it also works great with it to improve my look.

the powder is medium to full coverage which is accurate. with this product this means that one application will give you medium coverage (lighter coverage) and then you can apply more layers and build up to full coverage. one layer doesn't quite do as much as my cc cream. if i want light makeup, that may be perfect. if you are worried about picking the perfect shade with this makeup, don't sweat it. i received both toast and honey which are drastically different shades. both work for me! this makeup blends really well.

my favorite aspect of this powder is that it helps with the shine i get on my forehead and nose from oil. this is why i like wearing it over my normal coverage. it also stays on well, even when i sweat. i live in florida. its hot and i sweat a ton in the summer. i was wearing only only makeup last weekend when the air conditioning broke. it was 85 at the house i was stuck in for 6 hours (long story) and this makeup was still noticeably there after sweating and splashing water on my face.

5284,"reviewed by my wife: i have several dermablend products: the "covercreme" in several colors; the "liquid camo medium coverage foundation"; the "intense powdercamo". i got them for my daughter to use for stage makeup (she has been doing character makeup for a small shakespeare troupe in our county). it works amazingly!

this medium-to-full-coverage powder foundation is smooth, easy to apply and gives complete coverage with just a very, very tiny amount. i used the "suede" color, and swiped the included foam pad very gently across the pressed powder surface and it produced complete, near opaque coverage on my hand (see image attached - the medium color between the thumb and index finger on the back of my hand). it gives a satiney finish that allows for layering with other colors or highlights. it has an almost undetectable fragrance, and produces no irritation on my very sensitive skin. truly excellent product.",2017-06-19,5,5,A265IEMG2K5R4W,B00H2VO6P0

5287,"back in my twenties, i was a loyal dermablend customer because i had quite a few dark blotches from old blemishes.  in the 1980's, the formula options were strictly limited to a pot of dense foundation that had the consistency of concealer.  if i'm not mistaken, they didn't offer either liquid or powder foundations back then.

while my skin issues are pretty well resolved now that i've hit middle-age, i am starting to see a bit of hyper-pigmentation along the jawline so i thought it was time to give dermablend another look.  they're now owned by l'oral and have a more comprehensive product line.  this particular formula reminds me of the bare minerals solid foundation in that it applies like a powder but turns [somewhat] creamier as it sets.  the compact comes with a flat sponge applicator that makes it easy to control the intensity of coverage.

i received the beige shade which was a fairly good match for my fair skin with yellow undertones.  the coverage is buildable but it takes a bit of practice to achieve the correct application, particularly if, like me, you don't want to look too "made up."  if you need to hide blemishes or discolorations, this stuff does a superior job.  however, i felt that even the lightest application gave my skin a slightly shiny, taut appearance that was aging.

the verdict?  i think this would be an amazing foundation for someone who wants heavy coverage and it would work best on someone with firm, youthful skin.  for someone my age, sometimes less is more.",2017-06-18,3,4,A1Y7C52533BA2H,B00H2VO6P0
5288,"overall the dermablend powder acted much like i expected. i only put it on once a day since i have dry skin and only use it to set my foundation. i have to say, the foundation covered pretty well. once, i rubbed some over my lips when i was in a hurry to put foundation over my face and my lips disappeared. i looked weird. but unfortunately, the foundation didn't completely cover some brown spots. really make-up, you make my lips disappear but can't  camouflage brown spots? the powder helped cover the brown spots a bit, but no better than cover girl powder. so, i give it a four. decent powder, but a bit pricey. it does last all day for me, but again, i don't have oily skin.

here's a trick i use, if the powder is a little too light, which it was for me, you can add cinnamon to darken it. cinnamon adds a tan color, is inexpensive and good for your skin. i had to add a touch of to this powder to match my skin tone.",2017-06-18,4,4,A3V55DVYU80LDS,B00H2VO6P0
5289,"when we first tried this foundation powder, it seemed like it would leave a powdery look on skin.  however, the more we spread it, the more it blended and acquired a natural look.  we tried adding more layers, and discovered the more you put on, the better it covers.  however, the color was a bit lighter than we expected.  indeed, this color is for people with relatively light skin, meaning virtually no tan, and relatively light natural pigment.

this foundation is a powder, but it seems to blend nicely with the sponge or a decent quality brush.  we have dry skin, and the powder went on with little difficulty.  we are unsure how the foundation would go onto moisturized or oily skin.

the powder applied without irritation.  since the significant other has slightly sensitive skin, the lack of irritation is a plus.

we were slightly surprised that the powder came without any spf rating.  some foundations have spf 30 or higher.  we guess avoiding the sun is a good idea with this foundation.

the price is a bit high compared to budget priced foundation, but then again, there is something to "you get what you pay for" when it comes to makeup.  we consider the quality of the foundation to match the price quite well.

because the powder applies easily and smoothly, and blends into skin well, we like this foundation powder a lot.  it is great for covering up blemishes, especially with lighter skin.  the price, while a touch high, is reasonably competitive with other high-quality foundations.  we further enjoy the compact case with mirror, which is useful.  we are unable to find any flaws with the review sample we received, so five stars!

5294,"this dermablend intense powder camo medium to full coverage foundation makeup with matte finish has been my regular foundation for the past 3 years and i'm still happy with it.

this is a powder foundation but it has more pigment in it than bare essentials so it gives better coverage, imo. it blends out skin discolorations quite well and doesn't seem to get cakey if you apply it for medium coverage, as i do.

although dermablend says it is buildable, i find it makes my skin oily and it settles in creases if i apply it heavily so i would not suggest this particular product for people with oily skin that need full coverage. dermablend has other foundations that work better in that instance.

the ewg ( environmental working group) gives this product a great score. what that means is its not harmful to your body. they look at the individual ingredients and score them based on that.

i miss the "glow" original bare minerals gives, however i think my skin actually looks healthier now. the coverage is moderate, not too intense. i have to cover a couple acne scars with concealer.

pros:
good coverage
lasts long
doesnt wear off on my clothes as much as other products
doesn't pull oils from your skin=less drying
doesnt accentuate dry skin like others i've used or settle in creases

cons:
becomes cakey if you over-apply
better when used with a seperate concealer instead of building coverage

tips:
kabuki brush is a must, the sponge doesn't provide good coverage and looks more cakey
use a primer, i love ud's primed and poreless (gives a little coverage and hides imperfections more than most primers)

the only difference i notices with this retinol was that the burning/tingling effect was pretty unnoticeable. i didn't think it was working until, a couple days later...  in short, the cream does everything i'd hoped without some of the side effects i've experienced in the past.  nice job, obagi medical!",2017-10-11,5,4,A3O60C5513YYD6,B00IBDCYWK
5305,"obagi was one of the brands recommended by my dermatologist which is why i considered this retinol treatment over others. the packaging does recommend avoiding the use of this product if you are pregnant or nursing. it is a fairly small container, but it does not take very much product since you're essentially spot treating areas rather than applying it to your entire face.

i've used it around my outer eyes. while i don't currently have any deep lines or wrinkles, since i've entered my thirties i've started noticing an increase in fine lines. i feel like this product has been helpful for that.  unfortunately, you have to continue using these types of products or the wrinkles will eventually return (unfortunately, that's just the nature of aging).",2017-09-25,4,3,A1E5WXNTI7EO2A,B00IBDCYWK

i apply at night only, and am very pleased with the results. this is a product that i can see myself buying in the future and continuing to use as i really like what i am seeing in the mirror.",2017-05-31,5,5,A3094EPI56GKZ6,B00IBDCYWK

after a few weeks of using the above system, i switched out the .5 for this 1.0 retinol not expecting much of a difference, but i was wrong. within a day there was visible irritation in several areas on my face. i thought it might be a fluke and kept using it for another day, but it got worse (severe redness).  i discontinued use of all products for a week and went back to my regular routine and my skin cleared back up.  i then began using the .5 again and experienced no issues, so without going back to to the 1.0 i can only assume that the increased strength is too much for my skin. overall the product line seems good, but be cautious if you have sensitive skin.",2017-04-04,3,5,A353U0L2HAMSHV,B00IBDCYWK

5311,"the skin on my face is super sensitive at the best of times, and given that it's winter my face is super-super sensitive and so after one application i knew that i would have to wait until later spring, when there is more humidity and my skin could produce enough oil to protect itself, to try this retinol creme on the fine lines i now have.  my face became blotchy and irritated and i didn't use a lot.

so how to test?  looking around i decided that the back of my hands would be perfect as they look terribly old.  hot water, sun, gardening, etc. has made my old mom hands look very wrinkly and 'decorated' with some sun/age spots.  so good subject.  i chose one hand, the left, so i could compare and contrast.

dark spots -- this obagi retinol creme has lightened all of the dark spots on the hand i used it on, save one, the oldest.  i can barely see the other dark spots now,  and i'm pleased with those results.  i'll continue with the remaining spot.  perhaps being the oldest, it's going to take the most time and effort.

application -- i use very very little of this creme.  for one thing, it is difficult to get out of the tube.  but i'm okay with that. this is an expensive product so i don't want to use more than i need to.  what i use is several pinhead size dots on the back of my hand.  i then rub it in.  the retinol leaves my hand feeling soft and i've experienced no irritation.

*one of the things you absolutely need to do is wear sunscreen.  even in the winter i've been using sunscreen on that hand as retinol makes skin photo-sensitive.

wrinkles -- this is where i've been pleasantly surprised and kind of amazed.  the skin on the back of my hand looks and acts younger.  it has less of a papery, dry and thin old-lady look and it definitely is showing fewer lines and wrinkles.  even when i flex my skin in an effort to make wrinkles.

summary
i tested this on one hand so i could clearly see if there were changes.  the test hands now look different.  the one that has had the retinol creme looks younger and all but one of the brown spots is almost impossible to see.  can't wait to bring the other hand and my face up to speed.  from what i have seen, this product works.",2017-04-01,5,5,AQ6AGWKWMTY8H,B00IBDCYWK
5312,"i had my doubts that this product would do anything that noticeble for my skin as i am getting to an age where the smoothness is gone and in its place i have larger pores, uneven texture and uneven coloring (plus problem areas). the bags are starting and the smile crinkles are there when i don't smile. i resigned myself to reality and aging. i have used many good quality expensive creams and gels that feel good but don't seem to make any significant change.

but i started using the retinol 0.5 alongside the obagi professional-c peptide complex about 5-6 weeks ago. and while i don't have before and after (i wish i did now) i can't get over the noticeable difference. i follow the directions and try to use the sparing amounts recommended. i was concerned the first week of use because immediately after application my skin really flushed and then i got areas on my check and around the eyes that started peeling (a thin layer). i stuck it out and now i have neither issue. i must say, my skin hasn't looked this smooth and even-toned in ages.

i had my concerns as this is a skincare product normally sold under a dermatologist's care and observation. i really didn't have any problems and i am sold on the obagi line. with these results, i feel good to say that i believe the product i received is legit. the cream's not especially unique in appearance and fragrance-- a normal moisturizer type texture that i take care to spread out with 2-3 pumps of eraser-sized dollops. i'm very happy and plan to continue.",2017-03-30,5,5,A2GP6XJ1V3MM3L,B00IBDCYWK

5332,"as i have gotten older (late 40s now), i have become more interested in using retinol-based products to keep my skin looking healthy and to minimize the appearance of some of the growing lines and wrinkles.  this product seemed to be in the retinol range that was about right for me, so i was interested in trying it, and i have been using it nightly for about three weeks now--perhaps not yet enough time to see major changes, but i wanted to provide at least a preliminary review.

the good news is that i have not experienced any skin problems related to this product.  i know that retinol can cause breakouts, and i was concerned about this, especially given that i can be prone to acne, but i have not had this issue at all, so i was pleased.  in terms of improvement in my skin's appearance, i haven't noticed anything major.  it does seem like on the mornings after i use the product, my skin has a slightly more "tight" appearance--i.e., drier, less oily than usual.  but otherwise, i will need to continue l using the product for long to see whether i experience more significant benefits.

the major downside to this product is the packaging.  it comes in a small squeeze tube with a pull-off cap. to dispense the produce, you must squeeze the tube, and there is a tiny hole at the top which releases the product.  this process is very difficult, and it has only become harder as i have used the product.  this past past week, when i was squeezing the tube, the entire top popped off, and the product splattered all over.  (note:  this has happened to other reviewers as well.)  the tube wasn't very fully to begin with, so it is disappointing to lose product in this manner.  plus, the top will not pop back on, so now i have to reach into the exposed tube itself to use the product, which isn't particularly sanitary.

based on my knowledge so far, i would be hesitant to recommend this product.  however, i will keep using it and will report back if i see improved results.",2017-02-15,3,3,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B00IBDCYWK

i wish it was fragrance free because i'm quite sensitive to smells, but thankfully the scent dissipates after a short while.  it definitely appears to be the actual product and not fake as some reviewers have mentioned.  honestly, i don't know how the tube could be emptied and refilled anyway.  yes, there are quite a few chemicals in this, and i am careful not to overload my skin with artificial ingredients, but i'll continue to use this if i see results.

update  03/04/17:
well, i cannot use this.  after applying nightly for probably two weeks (per directions), suddenly i broke out in burning, red, dry skin where i applied it between my eyebrows.  researched retinol and discovered mostly recommended to apply every few days to build up for sensitive skin.  redness has not subsided after 4 days.  and because it makes the skin hyper-sensitive to sunlight, this will definitely not be staying in my house.",2017-02-12,2,5,A3I5YPJZMTG1QO,B00IBDCYWK
5334,"this does what it's supposed to do. i've been using this about two weeks. i'm definitely noticing fewer lines around my eyes and mouth, and the difference on my forehead is striking.

however - in the past i've had trouble with retinol products because of my very sensitive skin. i have eczema and retinol can cause that to flare up. but with this being a lighter strength, i thought i'd try it anyway.  the first few days i applied as directed, also being very careful to make sure i moisturized well on my more eczema-prone areas. after four days, i stopped using the retinol around my mouth and eyes as these areas where the skin is already thin were starting to redden.  after a few days, the redness went away, so i tried again, but only applying it every other day. this seems to work well so far, i'm still seeing reduction in thin lines but the redness has not returned after a week.

so my verdict is, if you've tried retinol in the past and had trouble, this might work for you.  take it slow and watch your face closely for changes, both the good and bad ones, and be prepared to adjust your routine. i'm very pleased with how it's working.",2017-02-08,4,5,ABOVQ74OQRZCM,B00IBDCYWK

i am able to at least use up the remainder of it on some small surgical scars elsewhere on my skin, though (just not on my face or the delicate dcollet area of the chest).  it does help with that...it was my dermatologist's idea.  i hadn't realized before he suggested it that retinol helped with improving the appearance of scars.  i guess it makes sense that it could improve the texture and appearance of scars, since it helps with wrinkles...so that may be a good suggestion for those who couldn't tolerate it on their face, but have an almost-full tube of this left!",2017-02-07,4,4,A141W8WHW9AC3H,B00IBDCYWK

it is very difficult to dispense the first use out of the tube.  i mean you really have to push hard for the product to come out of the tube. perhaps that might have been causing some of the issues.

5352,"first, i'll give you a tip: this appears to be virtually the same as the dermablend quick-fix concealer stick, which i use on my face. so if you're buying this for your body and it matches your face's skin tone as well, you can use it on both -- at least i have, with no ill effects. this stick is absolutely fantastic for truly covering nearly anything you want to hide -- though it might sometimes take more than one application. it's worth carrying with you if you're using the leg and body makeup, because i've found that that can rub off even if you've used the dermablend powder or spray fixative, and you might need touchups. like the quick-fix concealer stick, this goes on very smooth and generally stays put if you don't put a bunch of friction on it, and if you match the color it's dang near invisible. of course, you must match the color exactly, because dermablend colors are very precise. i recommend ordering a free color match kit from the dermablend website. it's really hit and miss if you try to go by the colors shown on your monitor.",2018-05-20,5,5,A1G60ANYI0HMEU,B00J66M2SM

5355,"my daughter has a scar right in the center of her upper chest and she's quite self-conscious about it, often trying to 'hide' it with a big pendant or other jewelry so she was quite happy to try this product. voila - it was quite the "quick-fix" for her problem.

she gently applied a thin layer over the scar (which is pink) against her very pale skin -- and this color matched her skin tone well. she waited a few minutes and then built more coverage with a couple of extra strokes. then, following the directions, she set the foundation by applying a coat of transluscent face powder. you can barely see any blemish as the coverage is great. it makes her feel much more confident and that makes me happy too!

i'm not sure how well this item would do for extensive disfiguring blemishes, but it works well on the fairly superficial ones. also "erases" visible capillaries such as those on the side of the nose, and other small imperfections much better than regular foundation products. you don't need a lot of it either. it didn't bleed onto her clothes either. it is also said to be water resistant. i'd definitely recommend it to anyone!",2018-02-07,5,5,A1WKQ94M45D8MG,B00J66M2SM

the most important thing on this, though, is to get the right color match. i wish i could have tried this in the store because online it's hard to tell. also something to keep in mind is the body is often a different color than the face so this was a bit too dark. i got the sand color and it had an orange tinge to it that works great on my face but was darker than my back and legs where i really needed the covering. it's very soft and smooth to apply to the face then smooth in with my makeup sponge.",2018-01-28,5,5,A2TCALF1IX7S42,B00J66M2SM

5358,"note:  the four-star rating reflects using this product as a cover up for dark spots and blemishes; it did not work for covering a tattoo.

i received this dermablend foundation stick free from the amazon vine program.  i like to use concealer to cover up a few dark spots on my face as well as some scars on my hands from a bad bicycle accident last summer (see photos).  overall, this dermablend foundation stick worked pretty well on my face, but i was disappointed at how quickly it came off my hands considering it is supposed to be water and smudge resistant.  then i figured out why (amazing what reading the instructions will do) 

i did not realize the 16 hours of wear is achieved by using this dermablend foundation stick in conjunction with setting powder.  i had never used setting powder before, but decided to order some to see if it made a difference with this foundation stick.  instead of ordering dermablend setting powder, i bought maybelline, because it was less than a third of the dermablend price.  results were that it lasted a bit longer with the setting powder, and perhaps it would last even longer with dermablend (versus maybelline) setting powder.

for curiosity, i had my daughter cover up a tattoo with it.  it did not work at all.  the tattoo was still completely visible, even when using setting powder.

overall, i would recommend this product for covering blemishes and spots, but note it should be used with a setting powder for best results.  i definitely would not recommend it for covering tattoos.",2018-01-10,4,3,APPJNVNF4BFLB,B00J66M2SM

5364,"i regularly wear dermablend foundation and concealer, so i was excited to try out their quick-fix body foundation. i tried it on my face as a normal foundation stick and also to cover some surgical scars for testing purposes. i do not have tattoos so i can't comment on coverage of them. i tested the makeup with three different blending methods- my finger, a beauty blender, and a foundation brush. the foundation brush provided the thickest single-coat coverage, but i preferred the slightly smoother look of the blender (though it required more product). it was easy to apply with all three of the methods.

pros:
- creamy, full coverage makeup without feeling caked on or thick. coverage is very buildable-- just let it sit for a few minutes between coats and blend! facial acne, undereye circles, and surgical scars completely disappeared using this product.
- long, long, long lasting! if applied correctly (with setting powder), you will not need to touch up at all. it also held out during a particularly nasty rainy day. though it is long lasting, i didn't have to scrub hard to get it off at the end of the day. it was easily removed with makeup removing cloths.
- didn't clog my pores. full coverage foundation scares this acne-prone girl, so it's always exciting when a product is actually truthful about its noncomedogenic status.

cons:

5367,"so dry.  soooo, sooo, sooo dry.

if you have oily skin, absolutely give this a try.  if your skin is combo or dry, prep your skin.  exfoliate, moisturize, throw on some rose water.  then let this warm on your skin (or in your hand) before you try blending it.  my skin is combo/dry and this formula was much hard to work with than i anticipated.  (also, use a setting powder, it, ironicially, helps it look less dry.)

as for coverage, i would describe this as fair to good, but far from exceptional.  i confess that i was expecting more from this brand's reputation.  amazon has given me the option to try a wide variety of demablend products, and with the exception of the setting powders and *possibly* the pigment drops, there's really nothing i've tried that i think i would try again. the coverage has (on none of them) met the hype of the brand's reputation.  they've been above average (compared to products from other brands), but they aren't "amazing" and i've found almost every product to be drying.

all color images for this brand look lighter than the color in person.  i would suggest you seek out additional color images (or visit a cosmetic counter) before deciding on your color selection.

all you have to do is rub the stick across the area. i personally like to blend it more, so i use a beauty blender to blend it in. another great thing about this stick is that it is build-able. you could easily add another layer if you need darker coverage. it makes my pimples/ scabs disappear and blend with my skin. it also does not irritate them or make them worse, which is a huge plus. i highly recommend this foundation stick.",2017-09-03,5,5,A39WWMBA0299ZF,B00J66M2SM

i used the 65w bronze of the 10 shades in this product line because that is what i was offered and will order the honey next which goes better with my fair complexion.

5389,"if you're familiar with stick foundations like nyx's mineral stick foundation, you may be surprised by the dryness of this dermablend quick-fix body foundation stick for full coverage. it is very dry. that dryness and the density of the pigment make it super effective as a second layer for discolorations that are not fully covered by dermablend leg and body makeup liquid foundation. i use it primarily to provide extra coverage after applying the leg and body makeup. it works.

i did not expect to have so much difficulty in finding the right color. i am definitely cool-toned, so i went with this 30c, which turned out to be too pink for me. i prefer the 30n for myself. but my guess is that getting the right color could be difficult for almost everyone, even though the color representations in the photos on amazon are unusually accurate. also, dermablend has changed its color names and numbers with this new release. you'll find older versions on many beauty websites under different color names that bear some similarities to these.

the product smoothes out very nicely and stays well once it's set with powder. i haven't purchased the dermablend setting powder because as i recall it's mostly talc. instead i use some loose powders and compacted powders i already own.

as other reviewers have noted, this is a surprisingly effective under eye concealer. stays put. doesn't migrate into wrinkles or into eyes (even on hot days).",2017-07-30,4,5,A2UM324B00HBC8,B00J66M2SM
5390,"this would be great for covering scars and tattoos. i used it for covering my large spider veins on my legs, along with the dermablend foundation makeup and it covers the veins better than the foundation makeup alone.

as long as you use it with finishing powder, it will stay on all day. it actually requires a fair amount of scrubbing to remove.

5394,"this is a proffessional product that makeup artists use to hide things like birth marks, port wine stains, tattoos and the like. it's a much thicker product than facial concealer and must be used properly in order to get the best results. as a paramedical esthetician i've often used this product successfully in concealing medical issues such as post surgical makeup (after facial correction, plasic surgery, coverage of vitiligo, etc.) as well as tattoos (while being surgically erased with laser), birthmarks and scars, burns, etc. i would, however, argue that this isn't a "quick fix" as the product is named, some care must be taken to make it look natural and last any length of time.

first off, if you try to apply this like a facial concealer, most likely you'll be disappointed. there are some super imprtant points i'd like to share so that this won't happen to you. there's info online about how professionals cover parts of the body with makeup like this, and it's really good to get some experience with how these body conceallers work before trying it yourself. prepping the skin is important to lasting power, make certain your skin is clean, exfoliated, and has been moisturized. remove any residue of moisturizer or wait until it has complete sunk into the skin. for dark tattoos, dark birthmarks and scars, a color corrector will help tremendously (shade will depend upon the color that you're covering), typically you apply the color's direct opposite on the color wheel to neutralize. purple is neutralized by yellow, red is neutralized with green, etc. dermablend does carry color correctors if you don't have any. apply/ dry the corrector (no residue!). then apply this product with a concealer brush taking care to apply sparingly, following the shape the the area until you have coated it with a thin layer that covers as much as desired. be careful not to remove the corrector underneath. blot if needed (you see too much makeup in areas). feather the edges into the skin with a sponge or beauty blender or foundation brush. reapply in any areas that need it (with the concealer brush) and blot gently. then apply translucent powder to set. you can also use a setting spray afterward if needed for longevity, or apply a light coating of airbrush makeup to blend even further.

this product is still the best i've found for coverage of larger body areas as well as small scars, etc. fyi: it looks much more natural if you apply a body makeup underneath and feather into it rather than bare skin. the color must be accurate, if it's off even slighly it will look fake. movie stars typically have airbrush makeup applied with any concealing for an hd look of "perfection" on camera. practice makes perfect, don't give up if you feel challenged trying to make it look good. professionals must practice a lot to do what looks easy...so go slow and have patience with yourself. if you have a special occasion that's coming up, practice at least a few times before the day arrives and you'll have a bettwe chance of getting the results you desire. check out youtube & the dermablend site for info and application tips. this body foundation will not let you down if used properly, that i can assure you.",2017-07-28,5,5,A2GA64WZK8PKBC,B00J66M2SM
5395,"i am a makeup artist.  i have tried a lot of different makeup from drugstore to professional brands.  one of the things that is very handy to have is something for the body if you need to cover a scar, discoloration, or a tattoo.  although i have some makeup that will do a good job, often it takes some time for application.  what i was looking for was something quick and easy in a pinch to use on those days when a full careful application is just not possible due to time constraints.

what is this foundation stick like?
like the old bonnie bell lip smackers in the large tube, this body foundation is a very thick stick that comes in a tube with a cap on it.  the foundation that i am reviewing is color 50c also called honey.  the foundation itself is similar to mac 37c but a little bit pinker.  in the summer this color is very close to my tanned skin.  since this is a body cover up stick, it is perfect.

how to apply
i find that this is best applied over moisturized skin.  it blends into the skin best when it has been moisturized and prepared for the makeup.  however, quick applications sometimes do not allow for pampering, so i also tested this on skin in emergency situations.  in both situations i applied directly to the skin and then blended the edges.  i put powder on top to set the makeup and then brushed off the powder.  when i say powder, i mean powder that is the same color as my skin.  i have also used a translucent powder which does not show up at all.

how does this makeup perform?
on surfaces that are uneven such as a scab, scar, or other skin problem, this takes some layers to cover. you will still see the uneven nature of the skin, but it blends it nicely into the skin so it is not as obvious anymore.  as far as full coverage, if i apply very thickly, it will eventually start to come off due to the nature of the thick application.  with a few thin layers built up, it works better.

with dark discoloration, bruising, or tattoos i have to say that this does not cover completely.  having said that, i find that using a corrector on the skin first which is the opposite in tone to the discoloration, i am able to tone down the discoloration nicely.  then when i put this foundation on top carefully with fingers or a damp sponge, it does cover a lot better.

for instance, if the large spot is red in nature, then a green corrector lightly applied on top will neutralize that discoloration so that when you put the foundation stick over that, it will be a little easier to cover.

other corrector colors you might need
 if you have a deep red or purple area, for instance, try using a yellow corrector.  for grey or brownish areas a pink corrector is usually best. for bluish areas you are covering up, a soft orange neutral corrector is usually helpful.

how does this wear?
in cooler weather, it wears nicely.  there are not any problems with it coming off or melting off as a really hot sweaty day might offer.  if it rubs on clothing or something, it will wear off some and has to be reapplied.  the stick is easy to carry, however, so that is not a huge problem.

in hot humid sticky weather, this is a little harder to keep in place, but it still works nicely.  i just try to keep the stick handy if possible, but not in the car, as it will melt and cause problems with the foundation stick.

i also found that this stick was not dry or cake-like.  it does sometimes have to be reapplied so be prepared to carry it with you in very important situation if at all possible.

the bottom line
convenient, portable, and easy to use, this body foundation stick does a decent job of covering body imperfections quickly and especially when a careful pampered application is just not possible.  it covers most things well and very dark things with a bit of corrector first.  wear depends on the day.  sometimes i get a full day, sometimes i need reapplication.

my rating
all in all, this is a decent foundation to have handy.  i would suggest if you really like having this on hand that you purchase two colors- one that blends with your summer skin and one for winter which is usually a different tone.",2017-07-28,5,4,AWIF8AR75LL9L,B00J66M2SM

5397,"the key here is blending. it is crucial to this product looking natural. therefore, even if you get your absolute closest color-match (find your perfect shade in the mall but buy it here!), you will still need to seriously blend this since it is for a small concentrated area. so apply this sparingly (you can even use a small brush instead of indiscriminately applying from the tube). once you have the area properly concealed, grab your beauty blender and feather out those edges especially ... blend, blend, blend. if you need to add a bit more, use a brush to touch up just those areas and blend again.

do use a powder to set this. (i used laura mercer since it is translucent and amazing). not only will it help prevent color-transfer, but it will provide a more natural appearance. (but, do be careful ... this will still transfer to clothing if one isn't very careful).  to the best of my knowledge, this is one of the best products you can buy to conceal blemishes, tattoos, bruises, etc.

it's not absolutely perfect, but in the right hands (careful and patient hands), it can definitely conceal whatever you need concealed. give it a try!  highly recommended!",2017-07-24,5,5,A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M,B00J66M2SM

5409,"my tan-complection filipina wife loves dermablend.

she has many different tones on her face and body, so she has several different shades she uses rather than trying to make everything the same color.  it turns out fantastic the way she does it.  i wish i could put a video up of her before, applying and after.  i've never seen any of her make-ups come out so well... plus it has a helpful spf to keep her from getting darker (yes she gets darker with sun exposure).

she's had a zit problem ever since arriving in the usa and has tried many products to stop them.  the only thing that has worked was going back to philippines for 3 months.  we have no idea if it's something in the ingredients of something she eats here, or some sort of spray on the vegetables... but she hides it when she wants to look really nice with an application of dermablend products.

she has 5 different creams, a couple of powders and 2 sticks, varying shades of tan.  she can apply them very quickly now, but of course had to study them carefully for what worked where and such.  i'm pleased that dermablend is available for people like her, though it's a little expensive for the amount you get (my frugal opinion).

the coverage worked on some things, but on others like a few tattoos, it really did not do the job. the skin tone was correct, was not using the wrong color. it should have done the job, but did not. i give it 3 stars because it does work on minor skin marks, making them less visible or not visible at all. it just should work much better than it does.

dermablend quick-fix body full coverage foundation stick, 40w medium works okay. don't expect it to cover as well as it claims though.",2017-07-03,3,3,A33SX0AD5PYD9B,B00J66M2SM

i have been using loreal products since the 1980s when my best friend was wearing a frosted lipstick i liked and i later sought out.  it smelled good too. it was a truer color in my eyes, since many comparable brands were putting red tinges into the light pinks and such.  also, some of the loreal colors of lipsticks and eyeshadows were pearly, and i liked them because they looked very ethereal, as with the pink-violet lipstick that changed colors depending on the light.

i have aged, and my last purchase was a loreal infallible product, one of many in a line which rarely or never need reapplication for my creased lids and bitten lips. i have been so obsessed that i have a whole zipper case full of the eyeshadows alone. i have a lot of products from their visible lift line for my skin texture. i especially enjoyed the blur ones.  now i am going to move on to have more choices in my zip bag.

there has been more exposure with loreal in my experience than i can mention here, including most recently, a lovely reddish-brown shade of eyeshadow that stays put, a super-mascara, another lip paint, some face-tone enhancers, and a creamy-to-dry, light-colored eye light, among others.

i am happy to see more high-end products from loreal that should work well for young and old alike, especially since it seemed to me years ago that their products were for my younger crowd.

1. dermablend professional cover crme with titanium dioxide sunscreen (30spf):
this is the first item in this line of dermablend cosmetics from loreal that ive received, and it is my very favorite.  it covers my skin imperfections well.

my first attempt with it doesnt count, since i spread it very thin, allowing a bit of dermatitis i had at the time to show some dry skin through.  and i went out that night wondering why this was happening.  first of all, i thought i needed to get rid of the rash that was there before reapplying and reviewing this product, and second, i thought i needed to exfoliate since i have sun spots. now i get it.  this particular crme has to be built up gradually for me. and building it up judiciously is not problematic at all.  it is lovely.

if i use a sponge applicator it will ruin one purpose of it for me which is to cover variable imperfections; and when i apply it with dab it appears blended, and i really find out how radiant and thorough a cover cream make-up can be.  it has alone a bit of chroma to it, as does dermablend pro smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation (25 spf),  in my opinion, unlike many other cover products i have used. alone, they gleaming the light more than my other cover make-ups, without chalkiness.  very nice.

the other purpose for me is that it has a (30 spf) sunscreen.  all other cosmetics with sunscreen i have tried have (25 spf) or lower, and not my needed (30 spf) that my dermatologist recommends.  she has said that even in my home with shades closed i am exposing my skin to potential damage.  i score 1,000 % here for this as well as the other qualities of this line.

the two colors i have are both medium ones, one a bit lighter, and both appropriate for me, especially my indulgence of mixing other lighter or darker colored loreal dermablend pro products with them.

ive been feeling a bit like a chemist with the many loreal dermablend pro products listed here. and i realize you may not have this type of a menu, but i am hoping this info will help somehow to see the flexibility here if not anything else.

2. loreal dermablend professional translucent loose setting powder (no spf):
needed. the wonderful crmes i love work nicely with loreal dermablend professional translucent loose setting powder with micronized powder, and hides flaws when that is part of what you are going for.  this particular product is very fine, not grainy, and perhaps a bit creamy.  it definitely blends in well.  it is very nice for creating a thin and matte next barrier, keeping the crme, bases, foundations, from smudging to hands, clothing.  in various ways, i am able to get some creative looks i sought in using them together:

 dermablend pro translucent loose setting powder in my three separate medium shades (separate jars); when applied and then dusted off created light on dark or dark on light look as i so chose. a. what i mean is that with the lighter shade of crme i was able to get the same look with the darker powder, as with the opposite of that technique using the darker crme and a lighter powder. altogether, with these medium shades i was able to get a perfect match, thus prolonging my experience.  b. also, with the white translucent powder i have found that i am getting a more dimensional look by applying the light shade powder on certain areas of my face, and on top or around in certain areas like cheeks, nose, chin, forehead, i will carefully apply and lightly dust the medium-toned translucent powders as described, allowing it to not look quite so much like monotone matte over my sallow complexion.  another plus 1,000 for me.

i have found recently that i need to put on fine dustings of all powders for myself.
pick your poison, as i have purchased some powder and crme blushes before today; though you may find it unnecessary if you want the dimensional yet minimalist look.

i like to play with the powders, yet, when i am in a rush i will make errors, not being subtle, and not dusting before other products.  also, i am 62, and my baggy under-eye application errors are the most noticeable. i get rid of this bagginess first.  i will use the powders now, especially with other lighter dermablend crme applications, or with the high-quality dermablend pro smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation (25 spf) listed below; and as well as their other foundations. all definitely for photos where a shine or two really counts.
one thing that helps give a nice touch over the powders and such is the loreal dermablend professional set + refresh long-lasting make-up setting spray. the powders are probably quite wonderful for an oily skin type, for example; they are nice for a youthful complexion; and i believe they are going to look quite radiant on a woman with less-noticeable pores, and without wrinkle issues along with age and skin texture combined.  in my case i am fine, and safest when i am well-rested.

3. loreal dermablend professional set + refresh long-lasting make-up setting spray (no spf):
these dermablend base products are synergistically enhanced with a nice sheen of fresh with a spray application of loreal dermablend professional set + refresh long-lasting make-up setting spray. just lightly mist your face with your hair pulled back to enhance your look and seal your make-up applications.  even with dusted powders it will make a difference.  it is that simple.

4. loreal dermablend professional smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation!! (25 spf):
this a product that i had underestimated until today when i applied it under dermablend pro translucent loose setting powder, which may not be necessary if you want that chroma look; yet because i preferred the variable built-up applications i achieved with the dermablend professional crme, i missed something with trying this last.  as before i was too quick to judge.  i had applied it very thick and then i went out.  i thought to myself that is was mask-like, yet nice moist cover.

not only can i variably apply this creamier product to cover the face and problem areas with my fingers, i can also use a sponge blender for a more airbrushed look, then applying more product to the flaws. this shade is a tad darker than the other shades of make-ups, so as with the crme, and the powders, i may experiment with altering the look as in 2a.  win-win-win.  i also may add a finishing touch of the dermablend professional set + refresh long-lasting make-up setting spray for a fresh stay; with or without powders.

5. loreal dermablend professional intense powdercamo!! (no spf):
this is a lovely and creamy intense powder in a nice mirrored compact with a sponge applicator, in other compartments.  while this color is quite dark for me, one quality, besides the products ability to render a thin cover layer, is that i do not see wrinkles really.  maybe the thin layer or the creaminess?  and the staying power, especially with the fresh mist of loreal dermablend professional set + refresh long-lasting make-up setting spray.  also, i can dab and smooth this powder wherever i want to whatever area of the face or neck.  the darker color, applied gently is making a nice bronzer.  i do know that is stretching it. i haven't tried it over the above loreal dermablend professional liquid camo product, since this is a very dark color; however, i am sure this might possibly work; though this does go on thin, and i do not think a crme or foundation is needed to get a good look. very nice camo cover product!

6. loreal dermablend professional quick-fix body!! (no spf):
wow again.  i hadnt understood at first how i can use this, as one of the colors i own is a darker bronze; and while i hadnt yet noticed the medium (my shade).  i mistakenly applied some of the dark under my cheekbones to see a defined look which actually worked for me, yet thick as i applied it - and silly me! i am thinking that since this product says body in the title it is going to be nice for use on varicose veins and other body imperfections like a permanent rash i have!  double win!

this is a creamy roll-up stick cover product which does the job, and which i won't feel shy about adding puffs of dermablend professional translucent setting powder so it doesnt rub off; and i will use the appropriate color powder as well as described above in 2a.  this is a lovely product.  i love the idea of having a smooth body-skin look as with the generous tube of the wonderful, and long-lasting dermablend professional leg and body make-up; however, im mentioning this first as im partial to a more natural, yet youthful, less unsightly look.  it isn't quite going to be looking as flawlessly airbrushed as the full body make-up, yet it is the product i will use first; especially during the day. love.

7. loreal dermablend professional leg and body make-up (spf25):
it is so nice to wear tights, stockings, or nylons during the winter to have confidence that leg imperfections will not be seen with dresses, and on ankles under pants above boots.  however, during cooler months especially, it is very nice to see perfect body skin peeking out of your clothing.  not only does this product render a flawless airbrushed look, it is actually very resistant to liquid or rubbing off onto hands or clothing.  i absolutely loved the look when i put it on; and then darn, i was noticing in the light that my shade was a bit peachier than my actual sallow skin.  this might not be problematic for you with full-body applications, as for me on an occasional basis as desired; yet finding your closest match will save you a lot of bother, and will please you i believe.  as i have expressed that this product renders a nice, airbrushed look, and i believe even because of the staying power alone this dermablend pro product is worth looking into.

8. loreal dermablend quick-fix concealer stick (spf 30)
this works fabulously; it is creamy and it stays put; it is smart just as the loreal dermablend professional cover crme, because it has that strength of sunscreen that my dermatologist recommends, even as i am in my home, shades drawn.  it covers very well, looks flawless with or without other products, yet it works synergistically with the wonderful loreal dermablend pro line. i have it in a tan color, and i would have thought since i usually use lighter shades of concealers that it would not have looked so perfect with my medium skin. lovely. plus 1,000, and very smart.

very nice products indeed.  enjoy!

5429,"this cover stick is pretty amazing. it's water and smudge resistant. and it provides for quick coverage, when you need it.

pros
1) dermablend quick fix body cover stick is small enough to slip in your wallet or take on the go.
2) does not require a spatula to apply.  it rolls smoothly over whatever you want to hide.
3) provides the same full-coverage that dermablend professional cover creme does.
4) doesn't need to be applied in conjunction with a base or powder.
5) i used quick fix body to hide a keloid scar on my thigh - and it stayed covered until i washed off the make-up with soap and water!
6) is lightweight and doesn't rub off easily.  yay!

con
1) dermablend is expensive.

i like to use a darker color then my foundation, when attempting to hide redness, so this color works well for that. i follow everything up with dermablend finishing powder. it stays on all day and provides great coverage. it is a nice, creamy formula. dermablend is a high quality company and so far i have been impressed with their products.",2017-06-29,5,5,A3OC93X866Z8TB,B00J66M2SM

i didn't want to downgrade the product because i used it for an unintended purpose but wanted to reflect that it didn't conceal dark circles on tender skin very well.",2017-06-27,4,3,AS44QEHT3KSPK,B00J66M2SM

5448,"firstly,  not the fault of the product but the color honey didn't match my skin at all,  so i won't remove points for that.  i will say that to use this product you will have to match your skin color perfectly or it will stand out like a red flag.  it would be nice if ordering online  to be able to order sample colors before investing 20 something plus.

i got this product  because at my age i have spider veins on my legs that i would like to conceal.
 the texture of the product is nice,  blends easily,  and has some moisture but isn't greasy.
coverage:  it hides my spider veins well straight from the stick,  but when blended i'd say it's about 70% coverage.

my biggest complaint is that it accentuates my crepey skin,...but i suppose any makeup on an older person would do so.
 if you are older and that doesn't bother you,  it's a good product to over some coverage  if you can find a perfect color match. it might fit the bill for younger skin if the color match is spot on.",2017-06-26,3,4,A1U8VI6I2MFEU8,B00J66M2SM

the coverage is excellent and a little goes a long way. even applied to hands and neck this works well on most areas.
it has good water and sweat resistance and stays on well. a quick scrub with a good skin cleanser and water washes it off. you do have to put some effort into it.

5450,"i'm going to buy this in my shade. i received this product for free through amazon vine. i knew the shade i got would be too dark for my complexion, but i really wanted to try it. i'm so glad i did. it reminds me of the max factor pan-stik i used back in the aughts, except not as oily. to make it "long lasting" you must use a setting powder. the directions say apply the setting powder, let it set for 2 minutes, then dust off the excess. i did this and it did not budge. i typically use a setting spray, not a powder. but i will make an exception for this foundation. it's full coverage, and once it's set with powder, it's not budging. i love that.

i love trying new foundations. i probably have about 20 different foundations right now. i've tried liquids, powders, cremes, aerosols...high end foundations i've special ordered from france, to low end drugstore brands.

right now i'm on a quest to replace my favorite foundation that was discontinued about 5 years ago. the original este lauder maximum cover camouflage makeup. i stocked up before they stopped making it, so i've casually searched for a replacement since then. este lauder made a "doublewear" replacement version of my fav, it's not as good, and it has very few shade options. i'm almost out of my old stock, so i've recently gotten more serious in my efforts to find a replacement.

my optimal foundation would be highly pigmented, full coverage, long wearing, waterproof, and transfer resistant. it can not feel like an oily/silicone mask. plus, if it's oily or silicone based, it's just going to slip off---therefore not transfer resistant.

this foundation is what i've been searching for. it's not as lightweight as my previous favorite, but it's full coverage (without feeling like a mask) and it stays in place once it's set! so, yeah, i definitely recommend this is you're looking for something that fits the same prerequisites.",2017-06-25,5,5,A2OX234OSU0SD1,B00J66M2SM
5451,"i am new to using the dermablend brand, but i have found that i really like it.  this is an ideal product if you are looking for full coverage.  i have some dark under eye circles and this make up did the trick.  i did not find the product irritating at all and really like the way this is packaged.  the stick is easy to use and a convenient size.
i do recommend using your finger to apply because it is easier to control the amount of product, if you just use the stick to apply directly under eye it is a little heavy.  i have used some powder to set it. the product blends easily and stays put all day.
i have not tried this to cover tattoos or bruises, but i'm sure that this could provide good coverage for those uses.",2017-06-25,5,4,A1EXGL6L0QQ0M5,B00J66M2SM
5452,"i have light olive skin, when i first rolled it on, it looked a tad too orangey for my skin tone. when i smoothed it on and it looked good and i could barely see it.  i really like that the stick is wide and thick, so you can you use it on big areas. it was easy to adjust the height and it goes down easily. i bruise easily, so i rubbed this over the smaller one, smoothed it, and i could barely see it. i also tried it on the bigger one, i had to use a lot more.",2017-06-25,4,1,A24O15MYDNLZBE,B00J66M2SM
5453,"this is an excellent product.  i have age spots on my face, and i have tried several products to cover them.  none of the products i have tried previously have been satisfactory.  i am very happy with the coverage  dermablend quick-fix body full coverage foundation stick provides.  i am amazed at how well this product covers and i am happy to not have the spots showing.  this stick is easy to apply, and i highly recommend it.",2017-06-24,5,5,A2TXMYYGSZCSZ1,B00J66M2SM
5454,"i ordered this product to cover dark circles under my eyes and little irregularities on my face. while i am not thrilled with the texture of this product (kind of thick & heavy) ) it does a good job for that. there is a faint scent that fades pretty quickly, which is great. the color i received matches the one in the advertisement well, and works for me & looks as natural as this stuff can look.  it's a bit more pricy than others i have bought, but a small amount goes a very long way.

overall this is a good, useful product. does what it says it will do, minimal scent, easy to carry, and lasts a long time. recommended.",2017-06-24,4,4,A2CJLDPPANU020,B00J66M2SM
5455,"this quick-fix body full coverage foundation stick from dermablend is pigmented enough to cover scars, birthmarks and tattoos, as well as various other skin challenges.

first off, you really need to go to a store in person to find the right color for your skin. dermablend makes a wide range of shades and the color must be spot on to get flawless, undetectable coverage. after you find the right color, you can order it online forever but the right color is crucial. there are many stores that carry the dermablend line. i go to ulta and macy's carries dermablend, too.

this is like a very fat lipstick and you can apply it in several ways. you can just glide it on or you can use your fingertips to apply ti or you can use a make-up brush. different methods work better for different skin challenges so take the time to practice.

do yourself a favor and use a setting powder. it makes all the difference in appearance and in durability. this will last all day without smudging or rubbing off on your clothes if you use a setting powder.

this make-up is buildable, meaning you can apply progressive, thin layers to achieve the level of coverage you need. again, practice applying it until you figure out what works perfectly for you. you'll be rewarded with great coverage that lasts all day.",2017-06-24,5,5,A1FDSZISWIXH1A,B00J66M2SM
5456,"i have a scar where i had a cyst drained. if i wear a low neck blouse or open vee type of shirt it can be seen a little so i thought i would try this. it covers it fairly well, not completely unless i want a dark spot there, but enough to where it's not as noticeable. i am now trying some castor oil on it and using my massager to try and make it shrink some. i'll let you know if that actually works. since i've had it for 2 years, i'm not too hopeful. i'll be happy just to have it dimmed down somewhat and this stuff does do that. it goes on smoothly and blends in well if you get the right shade for your skin.",2017-06-24,5,4,AX329NHW6B7BA,B00J66M2SM
5457,"it works well, it even covers tattoos. it's not greasy and it's specifically designed for acne prone skin.
once it sets, it lasts the whole day without getting smudged, and it doesn't stain your clothes.
it's waterproof, i.e. sweat resistant, but it wouldn't survive a whole day at the pool of course.
it works best for covering "flat" imperfections like tattoos or varicose veins. it's not so good at covering bumps like acne or choppy scars.
if you're not sure which shade to get, just go to a big department store like macy's. they'll help you pick out the shade and they'll give you tips on how to apply it.",2017-06-24,5,5,A3N876BDAQGWOU,B00J66M2SM

this did work, but with a bit of a learning curve.  i either didn't use enough or used too much the first few times.  i did not use the setting powder as i didn't have any, but the concealer stayed in place all day.

i had never used dermablend before, but had heard of it for years.  i wish i had tried it a long time ago, but i am glad to have it now.  also works well under the eyes and on dark age spots on hands and face and forearms.

the stick come in a tube like a lipstick.  it blends well and you can dab it right on the skin and then use your finger to smooth it out.  i  have sensitive skin and have noticed no ill effects.  i might also mentions, even at my ripe old age i still get occasional breakouts of rosacea on and around my nose.  this has worked wonders in hiding the rudolph nose.",2017-06-21,5,3,ATECU14VUIOJ0,B00J66M2SM

tap the foundation on then blend it lightly. let it dry and apply make-up. setting powder helps. the foundation last all day. dermablend has a make-up remover which works great.

dont leave the foundation stick in your car or a hot area. it seems to have a low melting point and you're likely to come back to find all of your foundation lumped in the lid.",2017-06-21,5,5,A2G04D4QZAXL15,B00J66M2SM

5478,"this "honey" color looks lighter than it goes on.  it has a very warm yellowish color.  it covers better than the liquid makeup, but it still doesn't cover areas with a lot of black ink well.  it covered red and blue very well.  also, i noticed for my husband's arm tattoo that we really needed 2-3 different colors because part of his tattoo extends to his lighter inner arm and up past his t-shirt sleeve line, so the tattoo itself is on 3 different shades of skin.  my makeup stick broke in no time flat, even without swiveling it up in the tube.  i stuck it back in there to use though.

the setting powder really helps with this.  it makes it look much more natural once it is on and it helps keep it from rubbing off onto clothes and it adds a bit of coverage itself.  i found that putting on the stick, then the setting powder, then going back over the black ink with the stick, tapping, then more setting powder, was the best coverage i could get.

this is very heavy, and it stays put.  it does take a lot for one application on a larger area though, so for everyday use this could get very expensive.  it's creamy and it goes on smoothly, but it is heavy and i feel it.  i don't like it on my face.  i feel like my skin can't breathe at all.",2017-06-19,3,4,A2R1HUYHXV7H18,B00J66M2SM

when it came to this vichy serum i didn't know what to expect but i really like it.  it has virtually no smell and it is very light on your skin.  hard to tell it's there at all.

i can't tell you how long the moisturizing lasts because i do wash my face ever day and my regimen is to put it on in the morning and at night -- mostly because with the onset of the beginning of fall my skin has suddenly gone exceedingly, ridiculously dry.

the consistency is not a lotion.  it's definitely a serum, clear and white both and very liquid.  when you use it don't push the pump all the way down.  a little goes a long way.  a partial pump covers my entire face.

one thing i will note is that when i began using this serum my face was a winter disaster.  already at the point where lotions irritated it and this serum was no exception.  it didn't 'hurt' my skin or cause breakouts, but it did burn a little bit. this wasn't because of the product though but because of the state of my dry, irritated skin.  after using this for a couple days that stopped happening.  basically because my skin had caught up on moisture.

the only downside is that it's a bit pricy. i have a hard time justifying it for just myself, so when it's done i'll look at what else is in the same category that's cheaper and potentially try it out. if money was no object, i'd gladly stick with this.",2015-11-10,4,4,AIJQU979J6UFY,B00KBH80TU

5504,"i'm always torn about how to review an item like this. there is no question that this is a tremendous moisturizer. while it might be most effective over time, at least some of the results are instantaneous. it feels wonderful and if your face felt dry in any way whatsoever before, it won't after you use it. as a physical object, a consumer good, it would deserve five stars if anything did.

but after long and careful consideration i have decided to dock this two stars. first, it is simply too expensive. partly this is a political decision on my part. our society is not just marked by those who have and those who have not, but every sign indicates that that this is going to be even more true in the near future than in the past. it might, in fact, dramatically intensify. not to get too nerdy, but we are at a point where robotics are shifting to a new level. it isn't just the roomba and the packbot, but an almost endless number of specialized robots. it is too early to tell for sure, but even conservative estimates are that this new level of roboticization, with an increasingly sophisticated a.i., is going to remove at least tens of millions of jobs off the market in the industrialized countries, with an extremely small number of new jobs created in response. until our political institutions respond to this change in our economic reality, inequality is going to increase rather than decrease. to put it bluntly, apart from this review bottle of vichy aqualia, i will never own another. i can't afford it. so l'oreal (the owner of vichy aqualia) has made a consumer good that i can't consume. docking this one star is my protest at l'oreal pricing this at a level that most people cannot afford. my gut tells me that they could easily have priced this at a fraction of what they have.

the second star if for the claim that this product was probably not tested on animals. strictly speaking, l'oreal's stated policy is to not test on animals unless required to do so by law. since no countries that i am aware of require the testing of animals for cosmetics, there is something bogus in that qualification. plenty of other cosmetic companies neither put animal products in their products nor test on animals. take the body shop as an example. are we supposed to believe that there are countries where l'oreal is required to test on animals but that the body shop is not?

i would like to buy this product, but for me to do so the price needs to be cut sharply and we need absolute assurance that this has not been tested on animals. i will add that i'm fairly confident that this product never was tested on animals. so what is really being asked is for l'oreal to boldly state that they are no longer going to test on animals and if a country demands by state regulation that they do so, to simply not sell in that country. in the meanwhile, i'll go see what the body shop has as a more affordable substitute.",2015-11-03,3,4,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00KBH80TU

5509,"the market for looking younger is seemingly endless. as a result companies give us countless face creams since thats where our age usually shows the most. so, i was obviously a little skeptical when trying this.

one of the biggest ways to look older (and just generally not attractive) is to have dry skin. this is where the serum comes in. it claims to hydrate skin to make it look healthy, radiant, and youthful. and, in this way, it succeeds.

its getting to that time of year when i struggle with dry skin, so it was a good time to try it. i have tried it out for a week and have noticed that my skin looks better. it also even feels better.

the texture is best described as milky. but, it doesnt feel overly oily or sticky. it absorbs nicely with no noticeable film. also, the smell is a bit strong at first, but i have found this goes away within minutes. use it at night if you're worried.

the product contains aquabioryl, which it is claimed to hydrate the face and keep a protective film over the skin. it also has hyaluronic acid, which is known as a humectant, meaning its a moisture binding supplement that, when applied topically, keeps the skin fresh and hydrated.

so, the product has the right ingredients and works. why did i take off a star? the price. i get that this is typical for these serums, but its way too high. one ounce is barely anything.

it really does seem to hydrate my skin nicely, even if if can't take 20 years off my looks.  it is very slightly sticky after application, but not as sticky as some other products i've used, and not so sticky that it affects my foundation make-up.  because it takes so little product, it is more cost effective than first glance would indicate, although its price is not high considering the cost of similar products.

i washed my face with a gentle exfoliator.  i used 80% aloe vera and my nuface.  i washed my face again with a chamomile bark, i patted my face dry, i put a small amount of vichy on my face.  a little goes a long way.  the scent was strong in my opinion but it fades quickly, and did not cause my face to feel that burning sensation normally associated with strong perfumes.  after i put the serum on - which is a thick, milky cream that spreads evenly, i let my face air dry a little and put my regular day cream on.  at the end of the day my face still smooth without feeling overly greasy.

i did wash my face again at night with an oil based cleanser, pat dry, put on serum, air dry, put on night cream.  in the morning my face was very smooth and still youthful and dewy.

for best results with any of the brushes, just move the brush lightly over your skin and let the device do the work. if you scrub your skin with it, it won't feel good. the device does it's best cleaning when it barely touches the skin.

i am a big fan of my clarisonic.  i've used it for years with various brush heads, from sensitive to the body brush.  i love the results i get.  i don't use my clarisonic every day, a few times a week, especially when i'm wanting extra soft skin or when i have small breakouts.

i get the brush wet and put a small amount of facial soap onto the brush.  then i use it on my face and neck by going in small circles.

after completing the brush cycle my skin always feels really clean and i do see a difference with regular use.  i replace my brush heads regularly, but i also worry about dirt, so i periodically douse the active brush head with rubbing alcohol while it is on to saturate the bristles and make sure they remain really clean.

ok, as you can see, i am a fan of my clarisonic, and i do believe it is worth it and does make a difference in my skin.

now to address the value pack presented here.  this is a good deal.  it is nice to buy in "bulk" and get a slight discount.  when i buy individual brush heads at the local department store i spend around $28, so that would put 4 at over $100, this is a better deal and i don't mind keeping a few on hand.",2017-11-16,5,5,A2H667ZUNLNTF1,B00LA5NKTM

over the years, i've figured out which brushes i like the most and sensitive is one of my go to brushes (though i also really like acne and cashmere).  i like it because it cleanses my skin without stripping it of moisture and feels really nice on the skin like a spa treatment.  because sensitive is my go-to brush head this set is great because it is more economical to get one or two.  that said if you're just starting out and trying to decide what works best for you i recommend one of the variety sets that has 4 types of brushes vs. one.  those are great so you can find the brush (or combination of brushes) that best suits your needs.

this brush set is awesome. it will probably last you for a year or more (if you use other clarisonic brushes along side this one)

about the brush itself - this is my least favorite brush in terms of output. it is mild on your skin so it is great for everyday use but in terms of immediate results, this is my least favorite brush. i use it every other day but long term i think this brush has helped me with a beautiful skin. if you are a fan of exfoliation type brush (the deep pore cleansing brush) you will find this brush boring but trust me it works wonders for your skin if you use it everyday or every other day for a few weeks. i like to use mine every other day along with the deep pore cleansing brush and the radiance brush (twice a week) and my skin has shown a huge positive difference. it has helped minimize pores, gentle on sensitive skin types and gives you what i call a clarisonic glow!!

5541,"i bought my first clarisonic (a clarisonic pro) more than ten years ago and wouldn't be without a clarisonic. it came with two brushes but the normal brush wasn't gentle enough for me, so i started using the sensitive brush and exclusively used that style for more than nine years with great results. notably, i've tried the radiance and cashmere brushes more recently, and they also feel comfortable to my sensitive skin (especially cashmere) and produce great results as everyday brushes too. but the sensitive brush is what i've used most and has served me well as an everyday brush for many years. i do vaguely recall an initial adjustment period of break outs when i first started using my clarisonic and that i worked up to twice daily use, but the sensitive brush is a comfortable brush for my skin and has never caused any skin irritation.

i've noticed a big improvement in how my skin looks and feels using the clarisonic with a sensitive brush head. my skin definitely gets cleaner and looks brighter and clearer than when i wash by hand or have tried other cleansing gadgets, my dry skin absorbs my serums and creams better so it stays more hydrated and my fine lines look less noticeable, and my skin texture feels much smoother and softer especially when i use my clarisonic with quality serums and creams. i rate the sensitive brush four-pack five stars as it contains authentic sensitive brushes that are the same high quality brushes as the single replacement brushes i've bought and used with great results for years, but the four-pack is a better value and a great choice whether for yourself or to gift to someone who owns any clarisonic given that the sensitive brush replacement head fits all models and comes nicely packaged.",2017-07-09,5,5,A2L6BT1PVV9YN0,B00LA5NKTM
5542,"these are the official replacement sensitive skin brush heads for the clarisonic electric body and facial brushes.  the bristle quality is perhaps slightly better than on some of the other compatible brands of replacement brush heads, but they also cost four to six times as much.

the best way to avoid irritating sensitive skin is to strictly limit the amount of time the brush is used, especially on the face.",2017-07-06,5,5,A1UQBFCERIP7VJ,B00LA5NKTM
5543,"i'm very pleased with this set of brush heads. the clarisonic mia that i purchased came with 5 heads, but only one of them was for sensitive skin. my elderly mother has dementia, and she recently washed her face with something not intended for facial skin. her face looked like a pickled beet for a week, and her skin peeled and itched. we used the brush head for sensitive skin on her face, with a gentle cleanser, and it worked wonders helping remove the dried, peeling skin gently and without further irritation.

if your skin is in good condition, you may not notice much of a difference in the brush head varieties. i didn't. but sometimes you need to know that you can clean your skin in the most gentle way possible. the heads for sensitive skin fill that need. the heads last a very long time.",2017-07-04,5,5,A33PVCHCQ2BTN0,B00LA5NKTM

5545,"i've had a clarisonic mia for about six years.  while i love it, the brush heads seem to need replacing every few months sine they always start to smell funky (even when i'm super careful about rinsing and drying them, cleaning them periodically, etc.).  i've since moved to a foreo cleansing device, which i like much better.

this four-pack is an excellent value, and the sensitive brush heads are perfect if you do have sensitive skin. they snap on easily, and do a nice job of gently cleansing your skin.

that being said, receiving these did encourage me to get my clarisonic back out and to use it again, but i really do prefer the foreo overall.",2017-06-29,4,5,A2V5R832QCSOMX,B00LA5NKTM
5546,"i've had two different clarisonic brushes and have tried both the generic and the clarisonic brush heads.  while the clarisonic brand brushes are more expensive, they usually fit much better and are easier to remove from the device.  the four brush pack comes out cheaper than buying them individually.",2017-06-29,5,5,A19KLUZ1XD3SRN,B00LA5NKTM

5548,"i love my clarisonic device and the way it maximizes the use i get out of the facial products i buy is amazing. my skin is very sensitive and i need to be careful about which brush heads i use. if i use one that is to harsh it will cause redness and skin will even break out from the irritation. the sensitive brush heads are amazing. soft enough that they don't irritate my skin but effective enough to get rid of impurities. i love the fact that they are just as efficient with my facial cleansers and serums as well. they suggest replacing the brush head every three months so the four pack would last you a year, so when that is considered the price is reasonable. when you take into account you can actually use them longer than three months (sometimes six months) and they will be just as effective it makes it even more affordable.",2017-06-19,5,5,A1TPWGBNIYJ76F,B00LA5NKTM

5550,"i love my clarisonic cleansing brush and was eager to try the various brush heads made for the unit.  this "clarisonic sensitive four piece brush head" gives you four brush heads for a nice price.  however, the sensitive brush heads feel no different, with the exception of the "cashmere cleanse luxe brush head", from any of the others i have tried.  each variation provides excellent cleansing action.  the only appreciable difference is the color of the band just inside the first row of bristles.

clarisonic brush heads last a long time.  although the company recommends you replace your brush head every three months, the one i have been using daily for six months is still in almost-new condition.  my recommendation is that you choose the variation of brush head that is on sale at the time you need new brush heads.",2017-06-17,4,5,A3MEMX0XF00TBD,B00LA5NKTM
5551,"i have a mia 2, and have only used the sensitive brush heads with it. since i have purchased this exact product multiple times, i must admit, it was nice to receive one for review purposes :)

i am glad they have created more gentle brush heads recently, because i don't have particularly sensitive skin, and yet i feel the "sensitive" brush head is still somewhat abrasive. if you're not careful, you can still overdo it and irritate/aggravate your skin--so don't be fooled by "sensitive". i would personally never get the deep pore cleanse or alpha fit brushes, unless i was using my clarisonic on my body. with that in mind, i love my mia 2 with the sensitive brush and use it 2-3 times a week.",2017-02-17,5,5,A3HZ687GB0AH7Y,B00LA5NKTM
5552,"you invested in your clarisonic ... and in yourself! so, while i know that these heads are a little expensive, they are also the best. (there is no doubt.)

as you would expect, the fit with this authentic head is just perfect (you aren't going to get that with a knock-off or generic head ... and the real worry is what it is doing to the actual clarisonic). likewise, the quality is outstanding. again, the plastic is durable (it cannot be bent or folded or dented like the generic, low-quality heads). and the head itself has thick, even, gentle bristles (these precise bristles are what keep your skin glowing!).

these heads are what makes your clarisonic amazing! they are as important as the clarisonic itself. and this one for sensitive skin is outstanding! it cleans without irritating! and that's no minor feat!

if you have sensitive skin and use a clarisonic, give this a try. if you compare it to the standard brush head, you really will notice a difference. and, i cannot say this enough ... buy the really thing! there's no comparison!",2017-01-28,5,5,A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M,B00LA5NKTM
5553,"this soft clarisonic brush head is perfect for my sensitive skin, but even though gentle, its really effective at cleaning and polishing. my skin feels silky smooth after each treatment. it replaces a slightly firmer brush head on a recently acquired clarisonic smart profile brush system. currently im using it with the cleanser sent with the unit, however, i another reviewer suggested cetaphil as an alternate that doesnt strip skin of vital oils and moisture.

i love the feel i get when using the sensitive brush head. i use it every other day to exfoliate and restore my skin to a more youthful glow.

the replacement head comes with a clear cover to protect the delicate bristles and instructions for mounting the replacement head. a superior product from a reputable company. invest in your skin with a clarisonic. youll be glad you did.",2017-01-13,5,5,ACQYIC13JXAOI,B00LA5NKTM
5554,"i've been using clarisonic products to cleanse my face since 2008, first with a clarisonic md and more recently with a mia 2. although i've tried other brushes, i keep coming back to clarisonic and its "sensitive" brush. i am outdoors a lot, and the sensitive brush is strong enough to remove any combination of makeup, sunscreen, and perspiration i ask it to.

the bristles are soft and flexible enough that they don't feel as though you're using a power scrubber on your face. if you're new to electric brushes, start with the gentlest possible pressure so that you don't stress out your skin. you may want to begin by using the brush every other day until you are comfortable using the brush. a gentle liquid such as cetaphil will help get your skin clean without stripping it. (i suggest cetaphil because it is hypoallergenic and works whether you have oily, dry or combination skin.)

any clarisonic tool is an investment, so it makes sense to use authentic refill heads, especially because they are what comes in contact with the delicate skin of your face.

this replacement head is packaged with a clear cover for the bristles, as well as instructions for mounting it on your clarisonic.",2017-01-08,4,5,A3KGLXW3EYDTUH,B00LA5NKTM
5555,"i have pretty sensitive skin - just scratching at it lightly can cause irritation sometimes, so i use the sensitive brush head with my clarisonic smart profile. i have bought knock-off clarisonic brushes in the past to save some money, but the "real deal" brush heads from clarisonic are a lot better. the cheap ones get frayed and funky after just a few uses, but these ones hold up for the recommended 3 months of use before you should replace the heads (yeah... if you're reading this and have been using the same brush head on your clarisonic for like, a year... time to get a new one! :)

oh, and this brush gives me squeaky-clean skin, doing just as good a job as cleansing that the regular brush head does. so don't worry about it doing a sub-par job just because it's labelled "sensitive".",2017-01-08,5,5,A2IKX7H2PLHULP,B00LA5NKTM

i use the deep pore normally---it's the same as the sensitive but it has longer bristles. i like that both the deep pore and the sensitive work on my face without any kind of abrasion or irritation. i have some sebaceous hyperplasia now and these heads don't cause any problems with it at all. ever since forays into buying clarisonic replacement heads on (auction sites and on here) resulted in fake heads i've not purchased anywhere but ulta. these are actually branded heads so i am confident i'm getting genuine product!

5563,"this brush head is a lot more comfortable to use than the normal brush heads.  i pre cleanse before using the clairsonic mia 2 cleaning brush, but this gets off remaining makeup.  even with the sensitive head, i can't use it more than 3x a week or my skin will get irritated.  the clairsonic can over-exfoliate your skin and while this is better than some of the other options, it still isn't quite gentle enough for my sensitive skin.  i used it consistently about a year ago and my skin was literally rubbed raw by the clarisonic so i stopped using it.  i picked it up again to try out this brush head and my skin was quickly irritated.

update:  i recently tried out the solo mio, which is sold on amazon and is supposedly a dupe for the foreo luna mini.  after using the solo mio i won't go back to the clairsonic.  i have been using it for about a week and it has not caused any irritation and is so much gentler than the clairsonic.",2016-12-14,4,1,A1GUX6R8DV3ZLY,B00LA5NKTM

5566,"this foundation is easier to control than other liquid makeup i've tried.  it's comfortable to wear and feels breathable.  it has great wearability and lasts all day unless i exercise heavily or get caught in a lot of rain.  however, it washes off easily with regular face cleansers!

i have sensitive skin and this product hasn't caused any irritation or breakouts.  there's no obnoxious fragrance or chemical smell.

one caution: while this makeup is very blendable before it sets, once it does, it's not budging.  the best application method i've found is to dot the foundation over areas i want to cover and then blend with a foundation brush.  it seems a little too slippery for fingers.  again, be sure to blend quickly as the foundation sets and stays!  also, start with less makeup than you think you will need.  a little of this foundation goes a looong way.

having this in my arsenal means i don't have to worry about those mornings when i have a big meeting or those evenings when i have to go somewhere fancy. i know that even if my skin looks terrible that day, dermablend can make me pretty again.

tip: before you order any dermablend products, order a free sample kit from the dermablend website. the color matching is critical for this brand and you can't trust what you see on the monitor. you need to see the colors in person.",2018-05-20,5,5,A1G60ANYI0HMEU,B00M0V39VE

but this surprised me.  even though it covers a great deal, it doesn't accentuate my fine lines and sometimes dry skin and wears well throughout the day.  i've been wearing it when i want a more polished evening look with a full face of makeup and it is perfect for those occasions.  for daytime wear i still prefer something more softer and natural but when i'm going for a bold lip or a smokey eye, this foundation provides me a perfect canvas to start from.

i also think this applies pretty effortlessly.  i've tried my fingers, a foundation brush, and my beauty blender and liked how it looked with all 3.  i also didn't have any trouble taking it off at the end of the night with facial cleaning wipes or my standard face wash.

that routine did not work for this makeup.  my first concern was that this looked entirely too dark for my skin while in the bottle.  after rubbing some on the back of my hand however, i noticed that it went extremely pale on application.  so i tried subbing it out for my normal foundation.  i discovered that rather than sitting smoothly on my skin - it bubbled up and sat on top of the primer.

i tried again the next day and left the primer out of the routine to see if that made for a smoother look.  moisturizer, then this new foundation.  once again the foundation refused to stay and went patchy on me.  (like oil in water - it's a strange look)

the next day was a weekend so i just slapped it straight on my face, nothing under it.  that was probably also a mistake.  i live in ohio and the weather here does a number on your skin.  so this went on much more smoothly but changed color to a much lighter shade when applied directly to my skin.  it also left my skin feeling rough (probably from lack of moisture).  so now i'm at a point where i'm not sure how to properly use this.  i have tried it with a few other moisturizers and some of them seem to work better with it - but they have to completely soak all the way into your skin before applying this or it will just sit on top of the moisturizer.

5618,"we have three massive make-up cases just for cosplay. and, since i have been the designated make-up person for the last five years ... i can tell you that nothing beats dermablend. in fact, the entire lower-tier of one of my huge train-cases is just filled with their products. you can buy cheaper but you'll end up layering three times as much product and it will not appear even remotely natural. you simply cannot buy better!

this foundation is perfect since it allows me to easily cover any blemishes my subject may have as well as any birthmarks/beauty marks (i even had one person with a star-shaped tattoo near her eye ... it easily covered it). and, what i really love is how once i have a clean canvas (one perfectly created by dermablend), i can layer over regular make-up (or more extreme cosplay make-up) without pilling, rolling, or smudging. powders, highlighters, creme blush ... all go on bright and clean. i can even do fine line-work ... and the lines go on sharp, and stay sharp!! i cannot say any other brand is as forgiving as dermablend.

finally, dermablend lasts until you remove it. we have used this for full days of photo-shoots and panels ... and it just stays put! (it's best to use a make-up removing cloth to gently remove it and then move on to a light cleanser like&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/liquid-neutrogena-facial-cleansing-formula-8-fl-oz/dp/b003bmi628/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8">liquid neutrogena facial cleansing formula, 8 fl. oz</a>&nbsp;with a clarisonic. this seems to really do the trick!) so, if you are worried about reapplying throughout the day, that has never been my experience or the experience of my subjects. apply it for the day and forget about it!

dermblend is dermatologist recommended and works like a dream. i have never had one subject have any sort of reaction ... ever! that says a lot about these products! please, do not be put-off by the price ... a little goes a long way for most everyone. so, start light and then build up the coverage slowly ... most likely, you will use less than you thought you would need.

she has many different tones on her face and body, so she has several different shades she uses rather than trying to make everything the same color.  it turns out fantastic the way she does it.  i wish i could put a video up of her before, applying and after.  i've never seen any of her make-ups come out so well... plus it has a helpful spf to keep her from getting darker (yes she gets darker with sun exposure).

she's had a zit problem ever since arriving in the usa and has tried many products to stop them.  the only thing that has worked was going back to philippines for 3 months.  we have no idea if it's something in the ingredients of something she eats here, or some sort of spray on the vegetables... but she hides it when she wants to look really nice with an application of dermablend products.

i'd describe my skin as fair and "neutral" as it has an olive tone (though my face also gets has a hint of pink), and the camel shade couldn't be more natural looking and perfect for me. i'm in my 50's with dry, sensitive skin and use this foundation over my serum and face cream, and it doesn't highlight my fine lines like some other foundations. i think it's a really complimentary foundation and have received numerous compliments. it's a really nice product whether i'm doing full make up or just want some natural looking coverage and sun protection for a casual outdoor activity. i'm really happy with the quality of this foundation and the camel color. 5 stars.",2017-07-11,5,5,A2L6BT1PVV9YN0,B00M0V39VE

pros:
- covers smooth and even
- lasts the day
- spf is good

cons:
- oily. i broke out using this the first two times; the third time, when i used much less, things went better, but i also put some powder on top to bring down the oiliness and im pretty sure that is whats helping.",2017-07-10,4,4,A3GFK7F5IUF60X,B00M0V39VE
5633,"this is another shade that was too dark for me. however, i did find a color that worked. i recommend using a primer first to make this foundation go on easily. i like to use it sparingly, so it looks more natural. a friend said my complexion looked flawless, so keeping this one.",2017-07-10,4,5,A3091RP0SPZLMN,B00M0V39VE
5634,"i have medium tones of southeast asian ethnicity. my skin is in the warm class with yellow undertones.

honey 45w was too dark for the skin on my face. it didn't really match, not even on my much tanner legs.  too much red and brown, not enough yellow undertone as the name "honey" might suggest. however, as i stated for my review for camel 30n, the product itself is very easy to apply, very smooth and liquidy - not too thick. camel 30n was great for my undereye area and concealed my dark circles satisfactorily. once you get a great match for your skin, i would recommend this product as a good every day foundation/concealer for very minor skin imperfections, especially with the 25 spf.",2017-07-09,4,5,A19RDMX22VXXSD,B00M0V39VE
5635,"i use very little foundation but will use it when going out for special occasions (usually night). the coverage was too much for my taste but it did look great. the foundation covered all my "little" areas that needed cover. it stayed all night and did not rub off.

i recommend it for when you want a smooth coverage.",2017-07-09,3,4,A2CF66KIQ3RKX3,B00M0V39VE
5636,"this is a pro makeup, so it definitely applies much better with tools like a foundation brush or beauty blender. it's far more difficult to get smooth, streak free coverage by using your fingers, it's not a drug store line. that said, when applied properly the coverage looks really natural on me, and doesn't accentuate wrinkles and lines. i find that concealer works better via brush over this foundation rather than under. this foundation is more "water based" and doesn't provide any moisture at all, which is why it lasts so long. what i love most is that it lasts in hot, humid weather. when i blot (don't rub!) with a tissue my makeup stays intact under perspiration. i wear moisturiser and sunscreen underneath, that seems to help smooth application and it also looks divine with a primer. it dries quickly, so care must be taken with application.

the coverage is very buildable over areas that need a bit more "help", smoothing and feathering with my beauty blender again, merges the makeup well into areas with lighter application. i haven't gotten any oxidation (turning orange) issues yet. i love how long my blush and other makeup (brows, eye area, around lips, etc) lasts when applied on top of this foundation. this product reminds me of revlon's colorstay makeup except it's thicker and applies a bit more sheer than that makeup, thus looks more fresh on the skin, and doesn't make my peach fuzz show up more like revlon's product does.

this makeup also passed the t zone test (i have combination skin but am primarily dry and use retin a for adult acne). i get greasy in this area and found that this makeup helps my foundation last rather than slide off of my face. my pores look good too, which is unique for a long wearing foundation that often makes them look more apparent. i love the sepia color, for my medium complexion with a bit of warmth (i no longer tan after skin cancer showed up) that's perfect for summer when i prefer my face to be a bit darker to match my light self tanner. i'm super pleased with this foundation! i do prep my skin prior to application (exfoliate regularly) and apply serum, moisturiser, and sunscreen or a primer for evening wear. my skin is also "mature". i've gotten a few compliments on how "healthy" my skin looks (my skin tends to be a bit blotchy naturally), so i'm definitely doing something right, lol. 5 stars, highly recommended!",2017-07-08,5,5,A2GA64WZK8PKBC,B00M0V39VE

 i should add here that i was at one-time on a first-name basis with the manager of cosmetics at neiman marcus.  i've tried so many and few have impressed me.  this one does.  this is so blendable and covers so well.  it doesn't cake on my face.  i have tried it with a sponge,  with a professional makeup brush. and with my fingers - all worked easily.

as i was not familiar with this company, i had not looked up their history.  i have no idea how long they have been around nor anything else about them (which i have done with many companies and products) but it's the ease and look of the coverage you get with this product that makes you fall in love.  i now have six of  the products made by dermablend and i'm next going to see if they have branched out into llipsticvk or mascara.  but even if this is all they make, i'm sticking with  them until some one comes up with the product that will make me the new 40.",2017-07-04,5,5,A368H9GFY1JCYC,B00M0V39VE
5647,"dermablend smooth liquid camo (medium to high coverage) foundation lives up to its claims!  this foundation provide good coverage using a dollop of product and lasts all day. the liquid is fairly "thick" but blends well. even though the product covers well, my face does not feel "cakey" throughout the day.

i apply a squeeze of liquid foundation to my palm and use a brush to blend in the foundation.  this camo foundation goes on smoothly, covers well, and doesn't settle into "fine" lines around mouth.  unlike the instructions in the ad, i use a brush instead of my fingers to blend the foundation because i find a brush blends better & uses less product in a single application.

the chestnut color was a touch darker than i expected (based upon the color chart), but will blend with my summertime color.  to use in the winter, i will mix with another, lighter foundation.",2017-07-04,4,5,A2SZLNSI5KOQJT,B00M0V39VE

i was also pleasantly surprised with how easy it was to wear.  i work at home and don't wear makeup every day, and often when i do it the feel of it on my face bothers me all day.  with this one, i actually forgot i had put makeup on until i went to wash up that evening and there it was.  it stayed all day, yet washed off easily.  so far, i have had no problems with it irritating my sensitive skin.  if you are looking for a full-coverage base makeup, i highly recommend you give dermablend a try.",2017-07-03,4,5,A1BTG38XSGYLW3,B00M0V39VE

i have been using loreal products since the 1980s when my best friend was wearing a frosted lipstick i liked and i later sought out.  it smelled good too. it was a truer color in my eyes, since many comparable brands were putting red tinges into the light pinks and such.  also, some of the loreal colors of lipsticks and eyeshadows were pearly, and i liked them because they looked very ethereal, as with the pink-violet lipstick that changed colors depending on the light.

i have aged, and my last purchase was a loreal infallible product, one of many in a line which rarely or never need reapplication for my creased lids and bitten lips. i have been so obsessed that i have a whole zipper case full of the eyeshadows alone. i have a lot of products from their visible lift line for my skin texture. i especially enjoyed the blur ones.  now i am going to move on to have more choices in my zip bag.

there has been more exposure with loreal in my experience than i can mention here, including most recently, a lovely reddish-brown shade of eyeshadow that stays put, a super-mascara, another lip paint, some face-tone enhancers, and a creamy-to-dry, light-colored eye light, among others.

i am happy to see more high-end products from loreal that should work well for young and old alike, especially since it seemed to me years ago that their products were for my younger crowd.

1. dermablend professional cover cr&egrave;me with titanium dioxide sunscreen (30spf):
this is the first item in this line of dermablend cosmetics from loreal that ive received, and it is my very favorite.  it covers my skin imperfections well.

my first attempt with it doesnt count, since i spread it very thin, allowing a bit of dermatitis i had at the time to show some dry skin through.  and i went out that night wondering why this was happening.  first of all, i thought i needed to get rid of the rash that was there before reapplying and reviewing this product, and second, i thought i needed to exfoliate since i have sun spots. now i get it.  this particular cr&egrave;me has to be built up gradually for me. and building it up judiciously is not problematic at all.  it is lovely.

if i use a sponge applicator it will ruin one purpose of it for me which is to cover variable imperfections; and when i apply it with dab it appears blended, and i really find out how radiant and thorough a cover cream make-up can be.  it has alone a bit of chroma to it, as does dermablend pro smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation (25 spf),  in my opinion, unlike many other cover products i have used. alone, they gleaming the light more than my other cover make-ups, without chalkiness.  very nice.

the other purpose for me is that it has a (30 spf) sunscreen.  all other cosmetics with sunscreen i have tried have (25 spf) or lower, and not my needed (30 spf) that my dermatologist recommends.  she has said that even in my home with shades closed i am exposing my skin to potential damage.  i score 1,000 % here for this as well as the other qualities of this line.

the two colors i have are both medium ones, one a bit lighter, and both appropriate for me, especially my indulgence of mixing other lighter or darker colored loreal dermablend pro products with them.

ive been feeling a bit like a chemist with the many loreal dermablend pro products listed here. and i realize you may not have this type of a menu, but i am hoping this info will help somehow to see the flexibility here if not anything else.

2. loreal dermablend professional translucent loose setting powder (no spf):
needed. the wonderful cr&egrave;mes i love work nicely with loreal dermablend professional translucent loose setting powder with micronized powder, and hides flaws when that is part of what you are going for.  this particular product is very fine, not grainy, and perhaps a bit creamy.  it definitely blends in well.  it is very nice for creating a thin and matte next barrier, keeping the cr&egrave;me, bases, foundations, from smudging to hands, clothing.  in various ways, i am able to get some creative looks i sought in using them together:

 dermablend pro translucent loose setting powder in my three separate medium shades (separate jars); when applied and then dusted off created light on dark or dark on light look as i so chose. a. what i mean is that with the lighter shade of cr&egrave;me i was able to get the same look with the darker powder, as with the opposite of that technique using the darker cr&egrave;me and a lighter powder. altogether, with these medium shades i was able to get a perfect match, thus prolonging my experience.  b. also, with the white translucent powder i have found that i am getting a more dimensional look by applying the light shade powder on certain areas of my face, and on top or around in certain areas like cheeks, nose, chin, forehead, i will carefully apply and lightly dust the medium-toned translucent powders as described, allowing it to not look quite so much like monotone matte over my sallow complexion.  another plus 1,000 for me.

i have found recently that i need to put on fine dustings of all powders for myself.
pick your poison, as i have purchased some powder and cr&egrave;me blushes before today; though you may find it unnecessary if you want the dimensional yet minimalist look.

i like to play with the powders, yet, when i am in a rush i will make errors, not being subtle, and not dusting before other products.  also, i am 62, and my baggy under-eye application errors are the most noticeable. i get rid of this bagginess first.  i will use the powders now, especially with other lighter dermablend cr&egrave;me applications, or with the high-quality dermablend pro smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation (25 spf) listed below; and as well as their other foundations. all definitely for photos where a shine or two really counts.
one thing that helps give a nice touch over the powders and such is the loreal dermablend professional set + refresh long-lasting make-up setting spray. the powders are probably quite wonderful for an oily skin type, for example; they are nice for a youthful complexion; and i believe they are going to look quite radiant on a woman with less-noticeable pores, and without wrinkle issues along with age and skin texture combined.  in my case i am fine, and safest when i am well-rested.

3. loreal dermablend professional set + refresh long-lasting make-up setting spray (no spf):
these dermablend base products are synergistically enhanced with a nice sheen of fresh with a spray application of loreal dermablend professional set + refresh long-lasting make-up setting spray. just lightly mist your face with your hair pulled back to enhance your look and seal your make-up applications.  even with dusted powders it will make a difference.  it is that simple.

4. loreal dermablend professional smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation!! (25 spf):
this a product that i had underestimated until today when i applied it under dermablend pro translucent loose setting powder, which may not be necessary if you want that chroma look; yet because i preferred the variable built-up applications i achieved with the dermablend professional cr&egrave;me, i missed something with trying this last.  as before i was too quick to judge.  i had applied it very thick and then i went out.  i thought to myself that is was mask-like, yet nice moist cover.

not only can i variably apply this creamier product to cover the face and problem areas with my fingers, i can also use a sponge blender for a more airbrushed look, then applying more product to the flaws. this shade is a tad darker than the other shades of make-ups, so as with the cr&egrave;me, and the powders, i may experiment with altering the look as in 2a.  win-win-win.  i also may add a finishing touch of the dermablend professional set + refresh long-lasting make-up setting spray for a fresh stay; with or without powders.

5. loreal dermablend professional intense powdercamo!! (no spf):
this is a lovely and creamy intense powder in a nice mirrored compact with a sponge applicator, in other compartments.  while this color is quite dark for me, one quality, besides the products ability to render a thin cover layer, is that i do not see wrinkles really.  maybe the thin layer or the creaminess?  and the staying power, especially with the fresh mist of loreal dermablend professional set + refresh long-lasting make-up setting spray.  also, i can dab and smooth this powder wherever i want to whatever area of the face or neck.  the darker color, applied gently is making a nice bronzer.  i do know that is stretching it. i haven't tried it over the above loreal dermablend professional liquid camo product, since this is a very dark color; however, i am sure this might possibly work; though this does go on thin, and i do not think a cr&egrave;me or foundation is needed to get a good look. very nice camo cover product!

6. loreal dermablend professional quick-fix body!! (no spf):
wow again.  i hadnt understood at first how i can use this, as one of the colors i own is a darker bronze; and while i hadnt yet noticed the medium (my shade).  i mistakenly applied some of the dark under my cheekbones to see a defined look which actually worked for me, yet thick as i applied it - and silly me! i am thinking that since this product says body in the title it is going to be nice for use on varicose veins and other body imperfections like a permanent rash i have!  double win!

this is a creamy roll-up stick cover product which does the job, and which i won't feel shy about adding puffs of dermablend professional translucent setting powder so it doesnt rub off; and i will use the appropriate color powder as well as described above in 2a.  this is a lovely product.  i love the idea of having a smooth body-skin look as with the generous tube of the wonderful, and long-lasting dermablend professional leg and body make-up; however, im mentioning this first as im partial to a more natural, yet youthful, less unsightly look.  it isn't quite going to be looking as flawlessly airbrushed as the full body make-up, yet it is the product i will use first; especially during the day. love.

7. loreal dermablend professional leg and body make-up (spf25):
it is so nice to wear tights, stockings, or nylons during the winter to have confidence that leg imperfections will not be seen with dresses, and on ankles under pants above boots.  however, during cooler months especially, it is very nice to see perfect body skin peeking out of your clothing.  not only does this product render a flawless airbrushed look, it is actually very resistant to liquid or rubbing off onto hands or clothing.  i absolutely loved the look when i put it on; and then darn, i was noticing in the light that my shade was a bit peachier than my actual sallow skin.  this might not be problematic for you with full-body applications, as for me on an occasional basis as desired; yet finding your closest match will save you a lot of bother, and will please you i believe.  as i have expressed that this product renders a nice, airbrushed look, and i believe even because of the staying power alone this dermablend pro product is worth looking into.

8. loreal dermablend quick-fix concealer stick (spf 30)
this works fabulously; it is creamy and it stays put; it is smart just as the loreal dermablend professional cover cr&egrave;me, because it has that strength of sunscreen that my dermatologist recommends, even as i am in my home, shades drawn.  it covers very well, looks flawless with or without other products, yet it works synergistically with the wonderful loreal dermablend pro line. i have it in a tan color, and i would have thought since i usually use lighter shades of concealers that it would not have looked so perfect with my medium skin. lovely. plus 1,000, and very smart.

very nice products indeed.  enjoy!

i am happy to see more high-end products from loreal that should work well for young and old alike, especially since it seemed to me years ago that their products were for my younger crowd.

1. dermablend cover cr&egrave;me with titanium dioxide sunscreen!! (30spf):
this is the first item in this line of dermablend cosmetics from loreal that ive received, and it is my very favorite.  it covers my skin imperfections well.
my first attempt with it doesnt count, since i spread it very thin, allowing a bit of dermatitis i had at the time to show some dry skin through.  and i went out that night wondering why this was happening.  first of all, i thought i needed to get rid of the rash that was there before reapplying and reviewing this product, and second, i thought i needed to exfoliate since i have sun spots. now i get it.  this particular cr&egrave;me has to be built up gradually for me. and building it up judiciously is not problematic at all.  it is lovely.
if i use a sponge applicator it will ruin one purpose of it for me which is to cover variable imperfections; and when i apply it with dab it appears blended, and i really find out how radiant and thorough a cover cream make-up can be.  it has alone a bit of chroma to it, as does dermablend pro smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation (25 spf),  in my opinion, unlike many other cover products i have used. alone, they gleaming the light more than my other cover make-ups, without chalkiness.  very nice.
the other purpose for me is that it has a (30 spf) sunscreen.  all other cosmetics with sunscreen i have tried have (25 spf) or lower, and not my needed (30 spf) that my dermatologist recommends.",2017-07-03,5,3,ACJ9N7ED37HXS,B00M0V39VE
5652,"i was curious to try dermablend, having heard about it for years as a great cover-up for all kinds of skin imperfections. and i'm always on the lookout for a product that combines foundation with hydration and a mineral sunscreen. liquid camo seemed like a good option: not too thick, titanium dioxide base; no moisturizer, but i'll take two out of three.

figuring out the right shade was not easy, and i spent some time on the dermablend site looking for clues. i did the pantone color iq at sephora so i know i'm kind of a darkish yellow. 45w honey seemed like a good match, but it proved to be a mellow shade of paprika, a skin color that few humans actually possess in nature.  nevertheless, i bravely applied it before an outing and the intensity seemed to fade quickly, or at least i got used to it. my family assured me that i did not look too orange.

the product stings when i use it on my face, and i do not have sensitive skin. after applying it, i am very aware that i have an extra layer on my face, something i normally don't experience. it's not easy to wash off! the foundation seems to protect me from the sun, but i wouldn't say it's the most cosmetically appealing product i've ever tried. i am going to save it for times that i'll be outdoors for a while and need something thicker and more protective. i tend to buy pretty expensive foundations, but this is a tiny tube (1 oz) for the price, not much larger than some tinted sunscreen samples i've gotten.

unlike some users, i'm not trying to cover up dark circles or rosacea or port wine stains, so i can't speak to its effectiveness in those situations. for me, it truly is just ok, a product i'll use but will not buy again.",2017-07-02,3,3,AR9GZ8B7NJJPN,B00M0V39VE
5653,"my daughter is really into makeup. she is excellent at doing things like wings and cut creases and all the stuff they do on those youtube tutorials. i had her use this and give me her impressions. she used the "linen" on her very light skin. she and i both have pinkish undertones, so this was slightly yellow on us, but most foundations are. the pictures are pretty true to color on the website, though i agree buying makeup online can be hard. she usually uses the lightest or next to lightest colors in the foundation lines, so the linen was pretty close on her. the coverage is about medium coverage when you put it on one lighter layer. she used both a beauty blender and a foundation brush, she liked the damp beauty blender better with this as it is very pigmented, a brush made it streaky. we both liked that you could build this foundation to get a heavier coverage. sometimes when you try to put more on a problem area or something, the new layer just moves the underneath layer around or wipes it off. this could build. that is very nice if you want to cover a blemish, scar, or red marks or if you just like a more full-coverage look. i like lighter coverage and acutally mixed a little with some face cream and it worked that way, too.  she set hers with translucent, loose powder (i think it was kat von d brand) and it worked very well. a tinted powder may be too much pigment, but you can experiment to see what you like best.  we may try the "cream" color to give us less yellow, but this is very close. the price is very good for the heavier coverage. will buy again.",2017-07-02,5,4,A3A90CELVLOUP6,B00M0V39VE
5654,"i am struggling with this product, it needs too much work getting in on properly without getting too much product on - when there's too much it won't blend and i have to wash and start all over. i did try some on my arm to see if i got different results, but still the same - it's either too heavy and noticeable that there's makeup there and not well blended, or not enough and i have to keep adding more. more work than i care to manage first thing in the morning, plus the added recommended application of powder.

note, this color was a bit too dark for me, and also too much red (or whatever color was there) and instead of covering some redness i have, it brought it out in all its 'glory'.",2017-07-02,3,3,A2F540P3L6P5CL,B00M0V39VE
5655,"the dermablend smooth liquid camo medium to high coverage foundation makeup with spf 25 is  amazing. the color way matches my skin tone perfectly. the coverage is professional looking. it's an added bonus that it helps prevent my skin from the harmful rays of the sun.  i can apply in the morning and the makeup last all day long.

my skin is oily and i often get undesirable blemishes and most make up has the tendency to make this worse but not this one. the coverage from this blend hides all imperfections and masks redness as well. it really good for dark eyes circles too.

this foundation is oil-free so it doesn't add to my skins oil. while blended in it doesn't make my skin feel heavy. a little bit of this goes a long way. you can apply with with your fingers but i recommend a makeup sponge. i felt that when applying it with my fingers that i used more of the product than needed. so a makeup sponge will extend the time needed before having to purchase again.

i like this makeup is fragrance-free, allergy-tested, sensitive skin tested, non-comedogenic. my skin had no irritation at all when wearing this.

the make up comes in a tube that features a twist top lid and a clear window so you can see what color it is from the outside. the hole the foundation flows from is fine in size to ensure you don't use more foundation than you need. if thrown into a makeup bag or into luggage i wouldn't worry about it coming open and getting on everything.

i highly recommend giving it a try! i'm very pleased.",2017-07-02,5,5,A194K60CWZ371J,B00M0V39VE

5658,"i'm a natural reddish blonde with a fair complexion. when i was young, i had lots of freckles. now i have some age spots. this creamy concoction is easy to put on (don't squeeze the tube too hard, it comes out easily, and you don't need very much). it covers completely, and you certainly are protected all day from the sun. it forms the recommended physical barrier, and takes some effort to get off at the end of the day. if you are a redhead with that porcelain skin that is so spectacular, but very very white, you will be able to use it as a foundation. for the rest of us, you will need to modify it. i spread it on (the first time i had to blot off the excess) and looked like caspar the friendly ghost. it has a little color, but not much. it did even out my skin tone perfectly. it wasn't cakey or anything. the texture is very smooth. it was just really pale, so i put my regular foundation and a little blush over the top, using it as a primer. that seemed to work fine. you could also get a very dark foundation or mineral color that matches your skin's undertone and mix it in, creating a custom color, before applying. it isn't scented, which is good, but it smells a little like the stuff they used to prevent baby's skin from chapping. if you like that, it's great. it's not bad, even if you don't especially care for that smell, you can get used to it. it isn't very strong. if you are going to spend a long day in the outdoors, or you just need a base to even out your skin tone, you might give this heavy-duty, creamy sunsceen a try. my skin is sensitive and sometimes still breaks out, especially in the summer, but this product didn't bother me.",2017-07-01,3,3,ABEAUXVVB2E1M,B00M0V39VE

5669,"dermablend professional smooth liquid camo foundation titanium dioxide sunscreen broad spectrum spf 25 natural is by far most popular medium beige, but it has an interesting application for concealing & neutralizing makeup not by hiding blemishes and discoloration in order to achieve an almost perfectly uniform appearance, which is extremely rare and thus uncommon, but by greatly reducing their intensity to make them appearing like a natural only slight variation of color typical to the rest and vast majority of us additionally intensifying with aging.  it is especially useful to cover darker or more reddish blemishes and discoloration, so the resulting hue, which is a product of making natural slightly darker, becomes a typical natural variant.  in other words, of 2 methods: (1) to choose a color matching the complexion to cover entirely the discolorations, or (2) to choose the natural color and to cover the discolorations with a thinner layer showing slightly trough, the second is much cheaper, as using much less creme, and does not produce artificial, mask-like effect, but requires more artist-like skills and also use of setting powder on the top to finish and protect the result.",2017-06-28,4,5,A3FOSLM5G1BO63,B00M0V39VE
5670,"this foundation provides the perfect amount of coverage.  it doesn't sit heavy on my face, and it blends well.  before applying, i use a concealer to cover up the redness in my cheeks.  then, i apply the foundation, followed by the dermablend finishing powder.  this evens out any oil in the foundation, and sets it so that it is less likely to wear or rub off.  the dermablend finishing powder is my favorite!

i use a makeup sponge to apply my foundation, and this works well with it.  this foundation is thinner then my usual foundation, however, it is thick.  it covers my face really well.  i would consider it more of a high coverage foundation.  it doesn't get cakey, and it blends well.

i really like this foundation.  it isn't too greasy and it dries quickly.  this color is a bit dark for my fair to medium complexion.  i find the way that the colors are listed on amazon, a bit confusing as to which color is the lightest to darkest.  if you visit other makeup sites, they list them in order.

5686,"this dermablend smooth liquid camo medium to high coverage foundation makeup with spf 25 covers my skin discolorations and a facial scar  as well as various other skin challenges.

first off, you really need to go to a store in person to find the right color for your skin. dermablend makes a wide range of shades and the color must be spot on to get flawless, undetectable coverage. after you find the right color, you can order it online forever but the right color is crucial. there are many stores that carry the dermablend line.

i've been using dermablend's camo powder foundation for 3 years now because it covers very well and is quick and easy to apply. this liquid version takes a little more time to apply and blend but i think the end result is a little smoother and more even. i am using a makeup sponge and i apply a fairly light layer and get a medium coverage.

i have skin discolorations from melasma as a result of having 7 kids and dark, under eye circles and a facial scar. this provides good coverage with a light layer. i can get complete coverage with a few layers but i hate wearing heavy foundation. i use a setting powder and it lasts the entire day. don't skip the setting powder because it's what keeps the makeup from rubbing off or settling into lines and creases. (dermablend makes a good setting powder but really, you can use any loose powder for this purpose.)

i will still use the camo powder foundation for daily use because it's just so fast and convenient but for times when i want to look especially good, this will be my go-to foundation.",2017-06-26,5,5,A1FDSZISWIXH1A,B00M0V39VE

5692,"this dermablend liquid foundation has a nice orange glow that would give a tan look to those with fair skin.  however, my skin is olive with a yellow undertone so it did not match.  that being said i still did try it on my face to check how buildable it is, the texture and the comfort.  first of it was very watery and very dry.  i would highly suggest heavily moisturizing if you have dry skin beforehand and using a primer as it highlighted uneven areas of my skin that were drier.  as to buildable, you can add more to cover up lighter areas but it just dried my skin up more and gave a irregular effect due to my dry skin and lay in lines or creases and accentuated them.  as a result,  it felt uncomfortable on my face and by mid day i could not wait to remove it.  (i tried it on a more humid day still same issues.)

dermablend suggests setting the foundation station with their powder, which might help any transference to things like my phone, but i haven't had any other issues with the foundation coming off or smearing, even when sweating. i spent the day outside, very hot with decent cloud coverage, but i didn't notice any darkening in skin tone the next day, so i'd say the spf works well. all in all, i was impressed by this. recommended.",2017-06-24,5,5,A39H1GO9E3YQIB,B00M0V39VE

it's biggest plus to me is its staying power.  it does not just wear off easily and you have to use a good deal of water, soap, wipes, etc. to remove it.  not that it is horrible to take off - it just stays on well.

the trade off is you know it is there more so than some other foundations.  it doesn't seem to irritate, but you do feel it present - at least i did.  i thought that was a detractor, especially at this price point.

it works well as a cover up though.

it is not inexpensive, so at $30-40 for an ounce tube, you need to love it.  a little does go a long way, but it is not cheap.

this foundation is full coverage. it's not camouflage foundation, but it has good coverage that is buildable. i've had trouble getting it to last longer than a few hours. i have combination, acne-prone skin. i tried it alone, with nyx matte finish setting spray, and with urban decay deslick setting spray. the sprays helped, but inevitably my face would get oily and the foundation swiped off. for this reason, i would say it's neither transfer resistant nor long lasting.

if you have dry skin, i think this would work great for you. it has high pigmentation, so you don't have to use tons of product to get even coverage. it has a beautiful natural finish that's neither dewy or matte.

when set with a powder the finish is flawless and lasts for hours. it covers any imperfections without a heavy caked on look.

5721,"dermablend makes different strength products to meet specific skin camouflage issues. some conceal almost anything and some are lighter formulations made to cover less pigmented skin issues. this is a medium coverage foundation with broad spectrum spf 25 protection. it works best on red and light brown discolorations but its not designed to conceal darker marks.

it successfully concealed a small red mark and a couple light brown age spots. after application it dries quickly. i rubbed at the covered spots quite vigorously to see if i could remove the foundation but the make-up was unaffected and the spots remained concealed.

the consistency is smooth but thick. i used a sponge to apply and the liquid went on evenly. make-up wipes worked well to remove the foundation. a little goes a long way, so squeeze the tube gently to avoid wasting product.

this is a heavier consistency than what i usually wear and i have noticed that when make-up contains titanium dioxide (used for sun protection) it seems to negatively affect the texture so it is a surprise it blends so well. no fragrance or sticky feeling and there is no shineon the skin it has a matte appearance.

the chai color is a medium beige with yellow undertones. it is just a shade darker than my skin tone but after application looked quite natural. the product is effective at what it is designed to do. finding the correct color is the trick although they do blend well if skin tone falls between two shades. excellent.",2017-06-21,5,5,A35Q0RBM3YNQNF,B00M0V39VE

this camo medium coverage actually did a good job covering a fresh bruise on my thigh. i bumped into a rock trying to clear a trail by the creek this morning. the resulting scratch and dark area is seriously ugly. one thin layer covered and hid 90% of the discoloration. unfortunately, the copper color is a tad too dark for my skin tone, but i am perfectly willing to find the correct shade for future use.",2017-06-20,4,4,A2O421DTA8J0RW,B00M0V39VE

application is smooth and seamless.  it comes out of the tube in a nice controlled cream, so you can very easily choose more or less of the product.  for a whole face i needed about one to two pea sized amounts, using a foundation brush.  i think if you used a beauty blender you might need a bit more.

blending was creamy and it worked well into my concealer - i am a foundation first, concealer second kind of girl and i found that the dermablend was very easy to integrate.

longevity was good.  once i finished my makeup i applied a powder (ambient lighting palette) to finish and set it, and over that a misting of setting spray.  i found it to wear very well for the next 8 or so hours, throughout an entire day of chores, some light gardening and cleaning.  i did not apply another sunscreen to my face and i got no sun exposure redness at the end of the day, so it definitely holds up to its sunscreen claims.  perhaps related to this is that the dermablend is not "dewy" the way some of the other cream foundations are - it is way more matte.

i'd say over all that this is a very solid product.  it covers well - even in the slightly wrong tone it glided over redness and smoothed my skin out very nicely.  it holds up to normal wear and tear and presents an attractive fairly matte finish.",2017-06-19,5,5,A2VHQDJBZH0Y7P,B00M0V39VE
5738,"i think finding the right shade of concealer or foundation online is hard.  i am not sure this is the right shade for me or my daughter, but going to give it a try.  i love the thickness of this foundation, it will definitely do the the trick to cover up blemishes or under eye circles.  if you don't like high coverage foundation, this is not for you.  if you need a highly pigmented, high coverage foundation, i recommend you try this one.  i am very happy with it, but i might need to try another shade.  i think this foundation might be enough to cover blemishes/dark circles, and might not even need concealer.  i like eliminating steps in my make up routine.",2017-06-19,4,5,A2065HBMYDXJ1S,B00M0V39VE
5739,"the last time i bought from dermablend was about 20 years ago.  back then they were known as the makeup that would cover anything.  i had a deep scar on my face from a dog attack and the dermablend would totally cover it.  as time and surgery went on, the scar is not at all noticeable now, so i don't need the heavy duty spackle of yesteryear, but i was interested in this new (to me) lighter foundation.

the product goes on easily and is not at all thick and greasy.  coverage is super, pores disappear.  30 spf sunblock.  sleek looking tube and package.  it lasts all day, you don't need the powder unless you are going to sweat this off or have really oily skin.

the only problem i have is finding the right color.  i wish the company would have one place at amazon where you could see all the shades, not just the four in your tone range.  i thought i was in the lighter tone family, but after using the bisque, i could actually go two or three tones darker and with more pink, less yellow.  i know the full range of colors are offered, it is just super hard for me to match them up.

the other thing, the names make zero sense to me.  i mean what is bisque?  is that like a lobster soup?  what is sienna?  camel?  chai?  i think numbers would be better, maybe ranging from yellow 1 to pink 1 to cocoa 1 or some naming scheme where we all have the same definitions of the product.",2017-06-19,5,3,A2ZJPDH0YP90SD,B00M0V39VE

5742,"the chai color is between light shades and medium shades.  it is warm with what i'd call yellowish tones. it goes on easy enough.  it is heavier coverage than any foundation makeup i've worn.  this covers light freckles, red spots well.  it does not cover very dark or black spots.  it covers scars as far as color goes, but doesn't do anything for the uneven surface that they leave.  it settles into lines, fine and deeper a lot, so it can age the skin.  it's comfortable for a couple of hours but then it begins to make my skin feel like it can't breathe.  i started wanting to take it off.  my skin felt oilier after i took it off, like the mask put my skin's oil production into overdrive.

my husband has a tattoo i tried to cover with this.  it covered the lighter colors up well, but it wouldn't cover the dark blue or the black lines.

it is water resistant.  it went through a shower without coming off, and hubby wore it into the pool and it stayed on where we'd put it.  it does come off with water based wipes though, if you wipe at it. i used dove baby wipes and it came off with some wiping effort. wiping at it seems to take it off pretty well without any special removers, but if just gets wet, it stays put at least for a bit.  it comes off really easy and fast with neutrogena makeup remover clothes.

it does stay on longer if you use the setting powder.  it isn't particularly shiny, but the powder helps keep it from rubbing off if you rub your face, and it gives it a nice matte look and a bit more coverage.

it's ok.  i probably won't wear it again all over my face because i just felt like my skin was suffocating with it on.  i might use it for camouflaging red spots, freckles, spider veins, or bruises.  for tattoos, if they are light colors with little black this may well work, but the dermablend stick does a better job of covering those, especially if they have dark colors and/or a lot of black.  this is very good coverage for smooth scars.  it also worked very well on the blue bruise i had on my leg.  it covered it very well.",2017-06-17,4,5,A2R1HUYHXV7H18,B00M0V39VE

once on, it feels soft and blends well.  i cover those spots and then use another spf tinted cream on the rest of my face.

i tried the foundation on the back of my hand to see how well it covered age-related blemishes, and it did really well.  i thought i had a bit of skin irritation for a short time after application, but that could have been psychosomatic because within minutes i noticed nothing.

this foundation is perfect for people with a slightly darker complexion, or when covering for darker spots might be needed.  the makeup goes on smoothly and evenly.  the lack of odor is a bonus.  neither the significant other nor i noticed any issues with irritation (exclulding my temporary imagined irritation).  the price is a tad high, but the price is inline with the price of quality makeup.  we think this foundation deserves our four-star rating.

i sometimes think the whole beard fad was started for companies to make some money. while that isn't a bad thing, it is skewed by marketing. this beard oil is healthy and pleasant smelling for uses other than facial hair. it can be used on the areas of the body, like the feet for example. i really like the knob tipped applicator. however, i feel this petite bottle is a little pricey for what you get.

the dropper is great for measuring out the small tiny amounts that a beard needs.  it only takes my son a couple of drops for his beard, which is full, but not long.  it adds a beautiful shine and helps the hair lay flat.  he likes it.  i like that it comes in a dark amber bottle, because he will grow a beard for a while then shave it- the amber bottle will keep the oils ready for use during the times he chooses not to have a beard.
if you find your beard looks oily, cut back on the amount you use, and apply it when the beard is wet, like right out of the shower or after washing your face.  in the right amounts, this oil will not make any hair look oily, only shiny and more smooth.",2016-07-05,5,5,A2R1HUYHXV7H18,B00PKA9NWQ

5784,"this beard oil gives a nice sheen to my beard. it lasts most of the day without drying out. it also makes the skin feel nice. i also appreciate the included dropper for easy application. i've dinged it one star because it has a slightly medicinal odor probably caused by the eucalyptus ingredient. other than that i can whole heartedly recommend this oil.

update october 2017:  not changing my review or star rating but just adding that over a short time (1-2 mos.) the squeeze top of the dropper turned rock hard making it impossible to get any oil out without just removing the dropper and pouring the stuff in your hand.",2016-06-29,4,5,A2DYW9Y2D8E43L,B00PKA9NWQ

5789,"my beard feels amazing after using this beard oil. what more do you need to know?

pros:

goes on easily. use the dropper to extract an amount, apply to a wet beard (right after a shower), and you're done.

i don't notice much of a smell. i see a lot of reviewers complaining, but all i get is a faint oily smell of musk and eucalyptus. i'm used to nivea for men's sensitive aftershave balm, which is very nonconfrontational so far as scents go, and i'd say the nivea smells much more than this beard oil.

cons:

none so far.

overall, my beard feels wonderful. get some.",2016-06-17,5,5,AC6LV5D2RKTIR,B00PKA9NWQ
5790,"beard oils serve basically two purposes.

one is to soften, condition, smooth down errant hairs, and essentially tame your beard. they are imperative for larger beards, but they also work well to soften smaller beards and make them less scratchy.

the other is to smell nice, like a cologne for your beard. the normal smells are musky, outdoor, woodsy, manly scents, as you could probably guess. i have one that has a rum smell for those of you who want to smell more like a pirate. or a homeless person. i guess there is a fine line there.

this one works well on both counts, though the smell is obviously very subjective. the price is very, very reasonable on this product, so trying it out won't cost you much. there is an eyedropper in the bottle, and a couple of drops is really all you need, even for larger beards. members of zz top will need more.

if you decide you like the smell, i recommend getting a trusted friend without a beard (you know, a woman) to give you their opinion on it as well. if you both like it, add it to your beard-taming arsenal. if not? well, it wasn't too expensive. and the dog is pretty hairy...

recommended.

5791,"i had to regrow my beard in preparation for this conditioner. i usually only keep mine during the winter, but this was a good opportunity to try growing a tamer version in the summer. i have many other proraso products and they're all very excellent; i expected to feel the same with this, and i was.

so my beard grew only about a little over an inch by the time i started using this. usually my beard grows thick and curly in the summer, and this time it was thick and stubby with a little curl forming at the ends. i applied this as directed and was rushed by the pleasant smell. i usually let it sit for an hour before the results fully kick in, and do they ever. even at the less-than-inch beard i have i can tell that my hairs are far softer and less churlish to the touch. i can finally rub my beard against my wife's face when going in for a smooch without being told it's scratchy. i might even let my beard continue to grow despite the crude chicago summer weather.",2016-06-12,5,5,A3R33KMESG0XGQ,B00PKA9NWQ

although the recommended amount to use is a dime-sized amount, that is a bit too much if you have finer hair.  his suggestion is to use a small amount, and then add more if you need it.

the dropper on this is also easy to use, and makes dispensing the product easy.

it does have a strong menthol scent to it, and it does linger all day.  just be aware of that if you're sensitive to strong smells.

all of the oils in this are also so good for your skin and hair, and it creates a nice sheen.  it's another great proraso product!",2016-06-08,4,5,A2V5R832QCSOMX,B00PKA9NWQ
5794,"confession: i wash my beard regularly. i scrub my skin, occasionally moisturize, and brush daily. so i was excited by the prospect of a beard oil tincture that promised to make my beard soft, smooth, and manageable. i would say by purported claims alone, the product is successful. my beard is tamer, softer, and looks better.

my issue is with the "side effects".  there are two.

1. smell. the oil has a distinctive odor and it lingers all day. i've experimented with not applying to my moustache area but the smell persists, wafting up my nose. i thought i would get used to it, but it's kind of annoying and sickeningly sweet. given its proximity to my nose, i was hoping for something a little more subtle. my advice is to use a single drop rather than a dime-sized amount.  even then, the smell is powerful and persistent.

2. flyaways. after a good brushing, my beard usually holds fast. after using the pbo i had a lot of stray hairs popping up in my field of vision. i thought it might be related to humidity or some other factor, but it's happened consistently now and i wonder if the oil somehow inspires my beard to take on a life of its own.

take my comments with a grain of salt; i've got unruly curly hair (including a curly beard), and my sense of smell is perhaps more sensitive than others, or maybe you choose to wear a lot of fragrance that might mask or overpower the oil's scent. while it might work better for others, i'm on the fence about the pros and cons of this product.",2016-06-07,3,5,A3S5WYWYKSAI9C,B00PKA9NWQ

this is a men's product, made for men, and made to help men who wear facial hair proudly... even us aging men with beards and goatees can benefit from using this product - especially older men, whose skin tends to dry out more rapidly and who benefit from moisturizing - a concept rarely practiced at an early age unless afflicted with a dermatological condition

although labeled 'beard oil,' this product mainly benefits the skin beneath the beard (although it does help the hair and follicles)

the smell is manly, a cedar and 'cistus' (i think the italian translator screwed up on the packaging text and really meant 'citrus') blend that can also supplant a light cologne or aftershave

while beard oil was commercially popular in the pre-depression era in america, its time has come again - men are being men again, and wearing beards - this means your face and the skin under the beard on your face needs a bit more attention...

you can use this two different ways.  the first is if you have a beard or are growing out a beard the oils in this will help condition your beard, help it from itching, and just make it look better.  you can also use this as a pre-shave oil, which helps tough stubble as well.",2016-06-05,5,5,AMS2CPERWN7JV,B00PKA9NWQ

 i switch back and forth between drench and aveeno products, sometimes using whatever was on sale that agreed with my skin and i would see a little improvement reducing that hanging skin, but nothing like this.  for that alone, this product is amazing.  i did sneak a little on my face and again, fine lines were  visibly reduced.",2016-03-12,5,5,A2TBZAC0XYHLIB,B00T07GQ3E
5801,"the vichy lotion is a high quality lotion. what makes this lotion different from some of the less expensive drug store moisturizing brands i've tried is that it's more about firming properties rather than moisturizing. i tend to get itchy dry skin and use a moisturizer after the shower. the vichy lotion does moisturize but the real difference is in the firming tightening of the skin.
the lotion comes out of the bottle in a more watery state than other lotions i've used, not as thick. but when it goes on it drys very quickly and nicely.
another property of the lotion is the scent.  i find the scent of the lotion to be a very pleasant one. it's a light clean smelling fragrance, though one that remains in the skin for some time after use. so if you prefer a non scented lotion this one is not for you. the bottle is quite an attractive angular tower in blush pink. it looks great on my sink counter so i can keep it out at the ready instead of tucking it away out of sight.
i would recommend the lotion and i feel like i would buy it again sometime, but because of the price i might rotate it out with some of the less expensive drugstore brands.",2016-03-11,4,4,A28I19Q54MYXGV,B00T07GQ3E

i tried this first on my hands and arms. it smells very strongly of perfume and the scent lasts, so make sure you like it as it will be there for a while! and it left my skin sticky. i elected to wash off and not use it any more.

original review-
apply before towel dry, after shower to wet skin.
i do this with oil in the shower bc it absorbs best. these were the specific instructions & i gather by other mixed reviews, that may not have been done. i've attached a picture to show how the cream melts into wet skin.

my skin is so soft & i could feel that bounce in my skin you get with a firming product.

there was no smell when i opened but when it turned to silk as it hit the water on my skin, there was a soft rose smell. a nice soft rose smell, not like your grandma.

i like the convenience of using a jar rather than a pump, as i can take as much or as little cream as i need at any given time. the price is a little higher than some of the other brands of drug store moisturizers, but it is definitely worth every penny. it is wonderful.",2016-10-23,5,5,A29VG90T649CSU,B00T07GQ3E
5830,"ive used several of the vichy skin care products and find them all superior quality that i don't have to worry about putting them on my delicate skin.  this ideal body balm is designed for use all over below the face and neck.

the best way to use it is right after showering when you skin is still a little damp.  apply this buttery cream to the areas of skin that are dry or crepey and massage in with a circular motion.  you don't need much.  for me i need it most on the knees and elbows.  both are showing age and are very dry.

ive found that the only skin creams that actually work as claimed are those that contain hyaluronic acid and/or lipo-hydroxy acid (lha).  thats exactly the formula you get in this vichy product combined with 10 essential oils and shea butter. the balm cream is fast-absorbing and you get no greasy remains after a few minutes of rubbing it in.  i really like this product.",2016-10-21,5,5,ATECU14VUIOJ0,B00T07GQ3E

5834,"ideal body serum-milk is made in vichy, france. it comes in a generous 13.5 oz. light pink pump bottle, so you get good value for your $29 (and prime shipping). good to know it is paraben-free and hypoallergenic.

from the female of the family: first impressions. the scent was a nice surprise (i'd love to have a bottle of the fragrance alone!). the "milk" itself is smooth and creamy, goes on easily, and lasts all day. my experience over the last month has been that it is not sticky or greasy at all, absorbs completely, and is deeply moisturizing. i've investigated lotions like this for many years, and there are 10 of my favorite oils in it -- jojoba and apricot kernel to name two. it also contains ingredients to help you get rid of dry skin -- hyaluronic and hydroxy acids.

i can see the improvement over the time i've been using the vichy product daily. i don't hesitate to use it on the sensitive skin of neck and chest because it is hypoallergenic.

it is a quality serum, and my new favorite in the arsenal against father time!

5837,"this product is reminiscent of the fragrant st. ives's skin products i remember using when i was in high school.  to my recollection, those weren't considered top of the line by any stretch of the imagination, kind of like suave with regard to shampoo and conditioner.  while this lotion boasts a list of enticing ingredients (or lack thereof) like "10 fundamental oils" and "paraben free," the proof with skin cream is always in the pudding.  in other words, did i come away feeling as though this helped my skin?  in a word, "yes," but i found it best used for arms, legs, neck and chest, but not for the hands or face.  in fact, the label clearly the label clearly states "do not use on the face."  while i sometimes have issues with eczema on my hands, i found that this product didn't work as well as eucerin hand cream for that.  in a pinch, however, this served sufficiently in lieu of using no moisturizer on my hands.  the lotion itself is smooth, with a moderate rose scent to it.  made in france.",2016-03-26,4,5,A3T6HX48F66512,B00T07GQ3E

5839,"i have been using vichy products for some time and i must say this is a good over the counter line that can be found in most drugstores.  this is the first time that i used their products for full body treatment (in the past, i used daytime and nighttime facial creams).  what is unique for this product is that it is referred to as "body firming serum milk".  based on the ingredient list, i am not sure how much firming this product provides, but it is a gold mine of the moisturizing ingredients.  i recently came from a trip to florida.  i normally stay away from the sun, but my skin gets sensitive with even the smallest sun exposure and ocean water.

it is important to mention main ingredients of this product.  it contains: hyaluronic acid (super moisturizing agent), lha, and a combination of the carrier oils: jojoba oil (that is super absorbent to the skin because its molecular structure is the closest to the molecular structure of the skin), sunflower oil, rosehip oil that is known for healing properties of the skin and apricot oil that  also has faint pleasing scent.

next important thing to mention is the texture of this product.  this is definitely not a milk, because you will find product is not runny at all.  it is also not a traditional lotion, because it appears to be thicker than lotion and thinner than cream.  perhaps because of the ingredients, product spreads on the skin easily and does not live thick residue.  it absorbs almost instantaneously and will not leave stains on the clothing like some of the body locations.  so for these reasons it is totally appropriate to call this product a serum.  it is almost a form of moisturizing primer for the skin.

finally the size of the product.  this is  a generous size product and it will last for 2-3 months if used daily.  i personally use it every morning after shower.  i recently restarted practicing baptiste style hot yoga.  i sweat a lot during and after practice and it is important for my skin to rehydrate on the regular basis to avoid flaking.  this is a perfect product and my skin loves it.  it is good for sensitive skin and it will not aggravate it.  i also like the pump that bottle uses.  pump allows me to be in control how much product i wish to use, which is not always the case with the oils.

it is unfortunate that bottle has pink color, so it gives impression that is only good for women.  i believe that this is unisex product because it does not have strong fragrance and it has amazing moisturizing abilities men can use it too, only most of them would probably be too embarrassed to do so by keeping the product on the public display.",2016-03-24,5,5,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B00T07GQ3E

5842,"the fragrance of this lotion is one of those that people tend to love or hate. perfumey and floral. it leave your skin smelling as though you've applied a perfume. and since perfume and if someone likes the scent is such a personal preference, those who don't like floral fragrances may find the strong scent of this lotion not to their liking.

i do enjoy the fragrance. i go back and forth between different types of scented products, and there are times when i enjoy floral ones. so this works for me. i'm using on my legs right now to help get them smoothed out for the warm shorts weather soon to arrive. it hydrates my skin thus giving it a smoother look and makes them feel quite nice. also by using this on my legs, i don't find the fragrance overwhelmingly strong.

this isn't meant for using on the face. it even mentions this on the bottle. it's a body lotion. it doesn't mention why it's not meant for the face, but it could be any number of things like the fragrance, that it would be an irritant if it got into the eyes, it could clog pours, etc.

if you enjoy bold floral fragrances and want a lotion that makes leave your skin feeling super soft and hydrated, this is a great choice.",2016-03-15,4,5,A1F7YU6O5RU432,B00T07GQ3E

i like the texture of this serum and also the smell. it might not be for everyone. i also think a little goes a long way. i will probably use it 3 times a week and switch between my other moisturizers. i can see the difference in my arms and legs, the skin looks smoother. i have used other products from vichy and they are fabulous. i guess you could say the brand just works for me.",2016-03-12,5,3,A2V9DTXTQ5YIMK,B00T07GQ3E

5850,"i tried first this bb cream through the amazon sample program, as i was having concerns about the shade selection. la roche-posay usually has great formulated and performing product, so i was expecting to like it.
with a thick mousse consistency, this bb cream applies easily and leaves a perfected looking skin, very soft and comfortable; for my combination skin i almost don't have to set it with powder. the finish is indeed matte and the pores are blurred.
i'm a yellow toned light-medium complexion (mac nc20, maybe nc25 in the summer) and the light /medium shade in the bb blur is a little too dark for me. since it's a bb cream, the color kind of adapts to my skin, but the coverage is light to medium, so it still looks off if it's not a match.
the spf 20 is low, and since it's a bb cream (you can't apply too much product) i would suggest layering it over other higher spf products.

note: if you get the sample, is a tiny 1ml packet. i'm still using the credit for a la roche-posay sunscreen, so it was basically still free.",2018-03-18,5,3,A2GI8X394RLF83,B00TBJWP86

the only drawback is that it does not seem to absorb any oil despite the description and needs to be set with powder.  in fact, effaclar is la roche-posays acne line but this is not at all drying.

i am of indian origin, i have the fair product, and it is too light for me. but--
this product goes on light as air, and when on, is softer than my own skin.
i'd almost say that this product gives you a pretty "glow".
no, it's not shiny, it's matte. i mean a healthy glow. very natural looking, though.
you know all those lovely actresses in korean dramas? they must use this product to make their skin look so good.
i've tried a few other bb creams (including korean bb creams) and this one is the best i've tried to date.
it's expensive, but worth it. a little goes a long way. i'm going to get the other shade because i like it so much. i just hope it's not too yellow for me.

5874,"i received the light/medium bb blur by la roche-posay.  the color is a bit too dark for my skin tone which is more of a light/ivory with yellow undertones.  that being said, i gave it to my daughter to use who 1) has t-zone oily skin.  she gets break outs on her forehead and chin and is always looking for a product that won't contribute to her oily areas.  2) she has a slightly more olive tone than me, but not by much and she said that she could work with the light/medium but wants to try the light.  as for the coverage?  the product itself goes on beautifully. it feels almost silky but not oily.  it is excellent for all day coverage.  my daughter loved the way she could canceal her blemishes without any caking and without any added oil.  just remember to powder lightly and set with a spray and you're good to go for hours!

we are going to try the light color and post an updated review after using for a longer period of time.  as of now, the product covers blemishes and sets beautifully.

5880,"i've been using this for a few days now, and really like it!  it really does blur out small lines and discolorations on your skin, and feels nice and light.

i always check paula begoun's beautypedia website, and they said this about it:  "effaclar bb blur goes on too sheer to cover more noticeable imperfections (i.e. deeply pigmented blemishes or dark spots), but its sheer to light coverage evens out the complexion in a natural-looking way. more to the point, the blurring effect really does help soften the appearance of pores and even fine lines to a minor degree. as for the claim that it keeps skin matte all daythat won't hold up if you have very oily skin, but you will at least get temporary shine control and this won't make your skin oilier."

i wear mac foundation in nw20, and this was light enough for me.  it would be nice if it came in more color choices.

the silicone in this also makes it glide on like silk, and it lasts all day for me, even though i have oily skin in my t-zones.  it is also fragrance-free.

it looks good from about 2 feet away, but up close it really settled into fine lines and looked like i had a full face of make up on.

i really like the texture, whipped cream more than liquid and it went on smoothly.  it definitely has yellow as its base undertone, so if you are rose complected like me it will look a bit odd, but it is good for under eye discoloration since yellow counteracts the purplish circles that show up with exhaustion.

however, i give it 4 stars because it touts itself as absorbing oil for all day matte skin. in this area, it did no better than any other foundation i have tried, bb or not. when it goes on it feels very powdery and smooth, but after a few hours my nose, which is my problem oily area, was greasy and needed a blot. still, it gave me a no makeup look which i really love.

also, i generally get medium toned foundations, or whatever a particular brand considers it's true medium. this is very orangy for a medium. another reason i give it 4 stars. it works fine on my nose, but on my chin to neck it was very obvious. so since i do like the texture a lot, i ordered the light to use both. it only comes in two shades, so i suspect that this might be something lots of women will need to do.",2015-06-04,4,4,A4UWNRY0WWECK,B00TBJWP86

i personally still prefer the brand sunday riley and algenist for my daily skin care routine.

- one step micellar cleansing water solution (1 fl. oz.)

- mineral 89 (1.69 fl. oz.)

- liftactiv supreme (0.51 fl. oz.)
  * this will help long-term anti-aging including fine lines & wrinkles, dull skin and loss of firmness - i did not see any difference in fine lines or firmness.
- ideal body serum milk
 * skin firming body milk or moisturizer * this is not for your face* this states it will provide 48 hours of continuous hydration, however i did feel like i needed to reapply by the next day.",2017-10-18,4,4,A93YMZM7YKG1G,B0157UMHXK

the delivery system works well for me - sometimes with pump-action bottles i get too much or it's difficult to control how much serum i want or it just squirts out--waste!, but with the way this bottle works i have better control and don't waste my serum! you just push the button on top of the lid and a little bit goes into the tube, you then push the button to release how much you want. perfect and works for me.

i love the corrective care pot of cream.  it is superb.  i also love the body lotion.  great products, gentle and softly scented.  wonderful!  i am not a huge fan of micellar cleanser in general, so i could take or leave that.  also, the serum is redundant, you can use it under the cream, or by itself.  one product in the morning, one at night.  i would rather just simplify, but i know that some people love layering their wrinkle solutions.  :-)

5909,"i was conflicted with how to rate this set. my feelings were somewhere in the middle, hence the three star rating. i like that this set came in an attractive decorated tin. i have a thing for tins and containers, so i was able to reuse/repurpose this for storing other items after i was done with products inside. having said that, i was a bit disappointed by the sizes of the products. i knew they'd be small, but didn't realize how small. after inspecting the bottles of each item in the set, i saw a notation that these were "free" samples, which actually made a lot of sense, because that is how small they really are. for instance, i only got two uses out of the one step micellar cleansing water before the bottle was empty. this makes the $25 price tag a bit steep in my personal opinion.

as for the items in this set, i can't really comment on long-term results, because there was just not enough product in each bottle to really gauge this. i can, however, comment on my immediate observations from a couple of uses (which is all i really got from each product):

one step micellar cleansing water: i use micellar cleansing water on a regular basis and have tried many brands. i really like this product and found that it did a good job at removing my makeup. just be careful not to get this in your eyes, because it will burn. the scent was also nice and reminded me of rose water.

liftactiv serum 10 supreme: i was on the fence with this product. for one, the dropper is so small that it was awkward to even use it to disperse the serum. upon initially applying this, my face did start to burn. after a few minutes that subsided and my skin had a nice, matte finish. with that being said, the burning really did it for me, and i won't be using this product, again.

ideal body serum-milk body lotion: another product that i was on the fence with. the consistency was lightweight, but this lotion did a really nice job at all over moisturizing. as a body lotion, i really did like this product, however, i wasn't sure if i liked the scent. it had a nice fragrance, but there was also this overpowering aroma of alcohol that i didn't care for.

liftactiv supreme moisturizer: i actually liked this product quite a bit. it was definitely my favorite out of the four items included in this set. the cream was thick, yet lightweight upon applying it to my face. it absorbs right away and gives my skin a nice, mattifying appearance. i would actually purchase this cream alone and give it fours stars (maybe even five) in a single product review, because i did enjoy it.",2017-07-27,3,4,AZQKNX6F8S84Q,B0157UMHXK
5910,"i am a tremendous vichy product fan. i already love and own all of the 4 products in this set. they come in a pretty tin which is easily reused.....mine is now working as a jewelry box. it's a substantial tin, too. the products include a toner style face wash, a facial serum, a face cream and a body lotion. they all have a lovely light scent which i find very pleasing. these are terrific products for sensitive skin.

the sample sizes are sufficient to discover if these products are for you. i particularly like the serum but they all complement one another. excellent to value and no "junk" products here....every one is a winner.",2017-07-26,5,5,AQY5XBYSENNZQ,B0157UMHXK
5911,"this trial-size vichy skincare set comes nicely packaged in a reusable blue tin and would make a nice gift or, say, shower door prize.

the cost is high for a travel-size set, but it does give you some of vichy's more popular -- and in the case of the cream and serum -- pricier products.

in terms of the products themselves, the ideal body lotion is a rather small tube (just a few uses) of good, but not outstanding, body lotion. not something i'd buy again, due to its cost, but a good product, with a light scent that absorbs well and goes on non-greasy.

the makeup remover is extremely liquid (water-consistency) and uses a cotton ball to apply. again, this is a true sample size, but would last through a week or more of daily use, assuming you'd mainly use it to remove eye makeup as intended. it did that job fairly well, needing a couple passes for waterproof mascara, but overall getting it done without stinging or irritating contact lens eyes.

the serum is about half a normal size but will last quite a while, as you use very little. it left my skin feeling dewy and can be combined with moisturizer, which is my preferred application method. i liked it, and the sample size is enough for probably a month or more if you use it every other day, as i tend to. (full size version of this product sells for around $45.)

the face cream was the nicest of the bunch, to my mind. dewy, without being greasy and worked well on my combination skin. i do wish it had sunscreen built in, but otherwise thought it was a good, mid-priced ($45 for full size jar) moisturizer, where a little goes a long way and i think this good-sized tub should last most women 3-4 weeks with daily use.

overall, i'd say if this was under $20 it would be outstanding; at a bit more than that, i still think it's a good set, since i did like the two most expensive products.",2017-07-25,4,4,A2Q8GFSEUSGJ51,B0157UMHXK

on to the product - honestly, for the first 2 days, i was largely unimpressed. i noticed no difference. by the fourth day, i realized the lines around my eyes, and on my chin, and forehead, looked...lessened, for want of a better word. my skin feels tighter to the touch after i use the liftactiv serum. i also have noticed my color tone is more even. my skin looks healthier.

the one thing that i don't like about this problem is the very strong fragrance, which seemed to linger longer than most. people who are sensitive to such things may have difficulty with this product. i would hesitate to get more of this cream for that reason.

5926,"i really like this serum. it's incredibly light and a little goes a long way (2-3 drops for my face). it feels like nothing and soaks into clean skin immediately, but actually feels hydrating when used alone, which surprised me, though i do like to use additional face cream at night for extra moisture (but it seems fine on its own by day). this is the first serum i've tried that was hydrating enough to use alone. but it is quite light, so i suspect in winter, my dry skin would require an additional cream around the clock.

does it make me look younger? i don't know. any moisturizer immediately plumps your skin and makes you look younger as long as you continue to use it--and this does a good job of that.

but i hate hate hate the bottle. it's dreadful. it's got a long wand affixed inside the lid with a rubber button, so it works sort of like an eyedropper, but really, more like a soda straw with your finger on the end. yes, it dispenses one drop at a time, but meanwhile the whole side of the wand (which is long, like the bottle) is thickly coated in serum, so if you bump the neck of the bottle going in or out, you get drops of expensive serum running down the outside of the neck and either getting wasted and making a big mess or getting contaminated when you rub it off with your hands. it's an awful design for such an expensive product. it should be a pump or some other clean, mess-free, portion-controlled application.",2016-04-14,4,1,A2RQOO8VYAEZZG,B0157UMHXK
5927,"this liftactive serum is intended to augment and not replace the use of moisturizers. use it once or twice a day, underneath heavier skin creams and sun screens to provide anti-aging benefits that are missing or reduced in the other products.

this particular serum contains rhamnose, a naturally occurring sugar from the buckthorn plant and hyaluronic acid. hyaluronic acid is a major component of healthy skin and when used topically, binds moisture to the skin and strengthens the skins protective barrier. vichy (which is owned by loral) claims that rhamnose has anti-inflammatory and skin soothing properties. this is based on a small sample clinical trial that was funded by vichy. whether vichys claim on the efficacy of rhamnose is accurate or not is anyones guess. lets say that it may be effective. it will take about a month to see if there are any real effects.

this serum is a light milky looking liquid that has a floral fragrance. it spreads easily over the face and neck and is absorbed quickly. i do not find the fragrance objectionable. if you are sensitive to fragrance, you may dislike this one.

it is dispensed from an eye dropper attached to the products cap. prior to unscrewing the cap, press down once on the button at the top of the cap. this fills up the eyedropper with the appropriate amount of serum. unscrew the cap and holding the dropper over an open hand press the button and the serum is released. i find that a single dose is plenty to spread over my face and neck.

i use this serum in the morning prior to applying moisturizer. so far, i have found it pleasant and easy to tolerate. my skin is soft and smooth and because of this, signs of ageing are diminished. i use a prescription generic tretinoin cream, .025% at night and so do not apply this serum at night, only in the morning.",2016-04-14,4,5,A2GHU8I0P3HFRW,B0157UMHXK

the sunscreen is a light cream, with a minimal smell. the cream applies smoothly, quickly drying down to a dry touch. this formulation is water-resistant to 80 minutes, broad-spectrum, oil-free, and won't cause break-outs. no stinging or migration into the eye area.

it doesn't have any oiliness after application, and does such a good job of absorbing oil, that dry areas of my skin continued to feel dry throughout the day - this is a good thing in hot and humid weather, when you need every layer to keep your face from turning into a swamp! the sunscreen is broad spectrum, and contains avobenzone, which can be extremely important for those who are physically sensitive to the sun; neither zinc, nor titanium dioxide provide the particular protection this ingredient does, though they are more stable.

anthelios clear skin is intended for facial areas so a relatively small amount goes a long way. it seems to me the people who have formulated anthelios have done their homework: i believe the reasons why anthelios agrees with me is because it's oil-free and is made with la roche-posey thermal spring water.  anthelios features cell-ox shield xl which is a patented uva and uvb screen.  altogether, i've found anthelios to be an effective sunscreen that allows me to enjoy more time in the outdoors without the risk of sun damage.

first off, it really is light weight. i was skeptical at first, because i have been fooled before, but this stuff went in incredibly smoothly.  and it did not leave a chalky, white residue on my skin, which is soooooo important to me because i have darker-than-many skin.

plus, it has 3% avobenzone, which is a great protection against uva rays.  many sunscreens only have uvb protection, which helps against burning, but not aging.  so i always look for either avobenzone or titanium dioxide.

and, its 60.  normally i would expect a uva/uvb rating this high to have sacrificed texture in order to get such a high rating, but, nope, not this one.

the only issue is that it's expensive.  if you experiment enough with cheaper alternatives, you may find something less cost-prohibitive.  but, honestly,  i've found that every decent sunscreen costs at least $18.  and this is formulated better than those.

high spf (60), and paraben-free make it good choice for those with sensitive skin prone to breakouts.
not just for your face, it also feels good on your hands.
reapply after 2 hours.",2016-04-20,5,5,A2YKWYC3WQJX5J,B01A0NT3D6
5955,"this sunscreen has been a solid performer for me. it applies smoothly, with just a little rubbing to get it fully absorbed. unlike other broad-spectrum sunscreen lotions, this product does not leave your skin feeling tacky or sticky, even when you are applying it.

once on my face, this lotion stays put, even on hot, humid days when i am doing yardwork or hiking, with beads of perspiration on my face. i have used other sunscreens supposedly for the face that break down with perspiration and get into my eyes  ouch! this lotion has not done that to me.

when following the simple directions of applying it 15 minutes before going into the sun and putting on a fresh coat every 1.5 to 2 hours, this sunscreen has protected me from any sign of burning. as part of testing it, i also placed a dot the size of a quarter on one of my legs and that area gained less color than the surrounding skin, which i had coated with a different sunscreen with a lower spf.

unfortunately, if you are sensitive to fragrance, this product does have the usual slightly sour bite that most sunscreens have, but it is less strong than most brands i have tried. as for the retail price, it is quite steep, but it does provide the added value of protecting against both uva and uvb at a high spf rating of 60. also of value is the fact that it resists breaking down when you sweat, which protects your face from burning, and your eyes from unwanted sunscreen. for me, even when traveling, the benefits outweigh the hassle and cost of having a supply of face sunscreen and another of body sunscreen.",2016-04-16,4,5,A3KGLXW3EYDTUH,B01A0NT3D6
5956,"this is a thick cream that has what it labels as face 60sunscreen spf 60. it does feel good on my face and hands where i spread it for sun protection. it is water resistant. it states this resistance will last for 80 minutes.
it does safeguard itself completely by saying that in order to protect yourself, you need to apply this and wear long sleeved shirts, pants sunglasses and a hat.
for me it works as a good sun protection, but i seem to have a skin that does not burn very easily. the best thing is that is a cool non-greasy or oily sunscreen.",2016-04-16,5,5,A2V92F5R7MLCVI,B01A0NT3D6
5957,"this is a surprisingly awesome sunscreen win. it's not sticky, and while it goes on thick, spreads out easily and does not take a lot to get a nice even coverage.
i can, and do, wear my makeup over it without any mid day melt, odd wear time or orange oxidation color changes.
yes, it's on the more expensive side, but it's skin care and i'm okay paying for the additional protection as long as it works. and la roche-posay anthelios works. no irritation, no break outs, and no super shiny skin.
the high 60 spf doesn't feel heavy, and when i reapply over the previous layer it's just as smooth as the first.
excellent spf.",2016-04-16,5,5,A5BJMAHZWGJ7N,B01A0NT3D6
5958,"i'm amazed at how nice this sunscreen feels on my skin. as a chronically pale person, i have to wear sunscreen nearly every day; otherwise i burn easily and end up with freckling and sun spots. i've found some spf moisturizers that feel pretty good, but because of the structure of the lotions, you can hardly ever find any with an spf above 20. i was a little concerned this one would feel heavy like the neutrogena dry touch sunscreen i usually use during the summer, but la roche-posay anthelios is light as a feather. my face felt soft and smooth, not sticky or oily at all, and it didn't affect how my makeup went on over the sunscreen at all. and, most importantly, it didn't make my sensitive skin break out after wearing it all day. and it's spf 60. fabulous!

it's definitely expensive. $20 for 1.7 fl oz is pretty high for me, but this is one of the nicest sunscreens i've had the pleasure of wearing.",2016-04-15,5,3,AH8SVUY191DSF,B01A0NT3D6

the sunscreen value is high and the scent is minimal, just an unscented cosmetic odor, not objectionable. there are no parabens. i haven't had a chance to research all the ingredients, but it seems to use alcohol as a preservative. for me, it's a choice between this and the cotz face broad spectrum spf 40, which comes in different skin tones but has a lower spf. i think you can't go wrong with a sunscreen with this high of an spf rating.",2016-04-13,3,3,A3QYDL5CDNYN66,B01A0NT3D6
5962,"a little too expensive but i think it works well. it's not oily and it doesn't leave a thick white mask on my face like other sunscreen facial lotions. i like that it doesn't clog my pores, a lot of lotions leave my skin with breakouts. i would consider buying this depending on how lay skin looks after long term use.",2016-04-13,4,4,A1R1BFJCMWX0Y3,B01A0NT3D6

5964,"this is a small tube of sunscreen intended for your face.  while i am tempted to use it for my arms and legs, i'm going to save it just for my face because it is more costly than my other sunscreens.

this product is light and doesn't leave your face feeling greasy.  i would definitely recommend it to anyone with skin problems.  i think it would be great for teenagers along with us senior citizens.

update: after a week my skin is raw, itchy, red, and inflamed. something in this is causing irritation which is pretty common for me with sunscreen. usually i can't wear chemical sunscreens without a problem and i'd thought this one would be ok because the brand is pretty good for me. not this time",2016-04-09,3,3,ARYSDAZNRXN6G,B01A0NT3D6

i am not blond, so i've never tried eyeshadow labeled as such. my hair is light-to-medium golden brown with reddish highlights and my skin is very light - in the ivory range. whenever i've used brown eyebrow pencils in the past, i've had to be very careful to just touch up the paler areas with the lightest touch possible. i prefer a natural look and it's always been ridiculously hard to achieve with my eyebrows in the past. just too much trouble, so i'd go out with natural brows that have faded, over the years, to a pale blond on the outer edges, after the arch.

-it goes on smoothly, so you don't need to press down too hard.
-the spool on the end is fantastic for brushing and shaping eyebrows! i have naturally thin eyebrows, so i can't get them shaped without losing them, and i appreciate a good brush.

well those are the only good things i have. moving right along...
-the color isn't brown. this is a lie. it's a weird greenish tinted color, which looks completely unnatural, except for maybe on a gargoyle. i could use mascara and have it look better.
-i'm not usually so picky, but the packaging is ridiculously difficult to get into. it took my husband and friend helping me to solve the puzzle of how to open this. and a lot of tears and frustration. i thought we lived in the age of frustration free packaging?
-this doesn't last for more than a few hours. and this could simply be because i live in the hot and swampy southern us, where we sweat all summer long. however, my revlon products last just fine, as do clinique and lancme. yep. i think it's just this little pencil.
i can't reccomend this at all, as i'm only keeping it for the spool which makes my eyebrows look good. but eyebrow brushes are cheap, and this is not.",2017-07-29,2,3,A2X3L31KCXBHCL,B01AYN0MBE

5976,"i wanted to love this eyebrow pencil but unfortunately i think i need to practice more and this color is just too dark for my hair still.  i was a dirty blonde growing up and now my natural color is a very light brown that is dyed red.  i let the red fade and the blonde is still too dark for my eyebrows.  my eyebrows are extremely thin and look overplucked.  once every six months i may pluck one or two stray hairs near my eye rather than the actual eyebrow because it just doesn't grow back.  i didn't want to ding this pencil, but i was not able to achieve a proper fill in.  too expensive and it felt a bit hard rather than waxy.

recommend only for those that have pin-pointed their precise color and also know how to properly blend and fill-in sparse brows.  pencil felt more like a cheap eye liner than a waxy product that should blend easily.  the brush did come in handy but not at that price.",2017-08-29,3,3,A30Z0GG96D11EO,B01AYN0MBE
5977,"note: two different colors of pencil are sold on the same page. i am reviewing the blonde color.

please note that i have strawberry blonde hair and brows so i was looking for the best fit for someone who has my hair color. my skin is also very, very pale. i found that the color of this pencil was a pretty good fit for me, though it was a little bit even in tone so i had to be careful to use it mainly for fill and to feather strokes along the outside to blend in.

in terms of how it goes on, it seemed pretty smooth for me. it's not creamy so it doesn't flake or go on too thick or too dark. this did make it easier to do the aforementioned feathering. the brush on the end makes it easy to shape brows or to more evenly distribute the pencil that applies directly to brow hair (as it can do a bit of spreading like a mascara brush, though not nearly as thickly or as wetly).

in terms of weak points, i didn't really find any significant ones from my perspective. it is an expensive pencil, but given that it's a bit dry, it doesn't need to be sharpened as often as it doesn't wear down as quickly as a softer pencil. i think that it probably is better than some of the other consumer-level mass-manufactured pencils, but probably not enough to justify the current pricetag.",2017-08-23,4,3,A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV,B01AYN0MBE

i found the pencil easy to use, short feathery strokes were best rather than any long, continuous lines. it seemed that they looked better on me. there is a nice little brush at the end of the pencil that helps make the brows look natural. i found it was very helpful in making the brows look smooth. the only problem i found with this pencil is the price. i think it is rather expensive and would have a hard time buying another.",2017-08-14,4,4,A1Y39T2CT36YL0,B01AYN0MBE

the blonde was darker than i expected but worked well for me, color wise.
the brush was awesome and i love it.

pencil is not super smooth like the urban decay 24/7 pencils, or estee lauder pencils, this is more dry, like the elizabeth arden pencils.
i personally would not purchase this again, first because the shade is not for me, and second because a dry pencil is not something i enjoy applying.

i love the color of this pencil. it's a softer brown really. but what i love is that it doesn't pull red. it has a nice neutral undertone. i think this is the first eyebrow pencil i've had in years that isn't too dark or too red. it makes a soft feathery line. it is buildable so if you are comfortable with a heavier brow, this is a good option. the spoolie is nice and also works for heavier or softer brows. this pencil stays put.",2017-08-05,4,4,A2P739KOM4U5JB,B01AYN0MBE
5992,"it's been difficult for me to find brown eyebrow pencils that don't have warm/reddish tones. this one is a true brown and doesn't pull any of those unwanted tones when i use it. it goes on smoothly; this is not one of those pencils that isn't pigmented or that requires a lot of pressure in order to get the product where you need it. as for the brown color itself, i'd say this particular one is a medium brown - it's definitely too dark to be considered light, but it's not so deep and dark that it looks entirely unnatural on someone with my very pale complexion and blonde hair.

the spoolie on the end of the pencil is great because this product is one that does need to be combed through once it's applied or else it does veer into unnatural-looking territory. the brush spreads the product just enough that it looks more natural and flattering.

there are just a few downsides to this for me: this is just a personal preference, but having to (eventually) use a sharpener on this is not ideal - i do prefer the automatically sharpened eyebrow pencils that you can advance by twisting the bottom. also, this is isn't easy to remove; even after i went over it with a cleansing cloth and then a makeup remover and then an actual cleanser, there was still some pigment left behind. finally, while it is a good product, the price point is on the high side.

other than those things, though, i do think this is a good eyebrow pencil, and i would recommend it.",2017-08-04,4,3,A209XHC20QAYM,B01AYN0MBE

5994,"let me start by saying, i love the actual product. it's a big enough pencil to justify the price. the consistency is wonderful... it's a gel-like feel, so it glides onto the skin and looks very natural. i like that the spoolie is attached. i'm used to needing two hands to fill in my brows, and this makes it much more efficient.

here's my problem - the dark blonde shade is way too dark! it's what i would use if i had medium brown hair. i compared it side-by-side with my cheap-o cover girl dark blonde pencils and they don't even look like they are in the same color family, let alone the same shade. i am fair-skinned with red hair and the blonde usually just fills in for me without darkening much.

i will still use it, but definitely not daily. this will be for a dramatic look; more of a dolled-up night out. such a shame! i would have loved to make it my new staple.",2017-08-03,3,3,A7H1LWFBE905R,B01AYN0MBE

i got the blonde shade, and it's a good shade, not green or any weird color...this would work for people with brown hair also. i found the pencil itself too soft. i prefer a pencil made by ybf sold on a shopping channel. the ybf brow pencil comes in one shade, is a harder pencil that doesn't crumble like this one and is retractable.

with this laroche-posay pencil, you'll also need a pencil sharpener, not included.

if the ybf pencil ever becomes unavailable, i'll probably buy this one. it's still better than most i've tried in the past. but not better than the ybf pencil.",2017-08-02,3,3,A3CG93783LP0FO,B01AYN0MBE

6008,"i used to go to a top dermatologist in beverly hills and he told me that skinmedica products were the best. the one he touted most highly was their tns essential serum and i used that one for a long time. the only reason i stopped was because it just became too expensive.

by the way, as far as being expensive, i don't like to take any stars off of any product because of its price; i believe a review should reflect how a product works and if it does what its supposed to do.

saying that, i was really excited to try this because i am such a fan of skinmedica products and because this product sounded like the perfect fix for the dryness on my face and neck from aging. plus, i also really liked how you can use this rejuvenating hydrator either before or after moisturizer and i did try it both ways.

so why not 5 stars? because unfortunately, for me, this product really didn't help. if anything, i thought it made my skin feel even drier. after a couple of weeks and after trying it on different parts of my body - i.e. neck and upper chest - i finally threw in the towel and decided it wasn't for me.

an additional issue, is that if you have telangiectasia like i do, this product might only make it worse and it made my face look  flushed. not good.

so this was a difficult review for me because i think that this company makes quality products and i think this would probably be a boon to most people. but for someone like me - someone who has telangiectasia and very sensitive skin - this proved to be more detrimental than good.",2018-05-18,3,3,A2GPJR489OIH42,B01B3QIEPC

6012,"my knee jerk reaction when i see a high priced skin topical solutions is to immediately be skeptical. i believe that most skin enhancing results are gained through a healthy diet, sufficient sleep and limiting stress, accompanied by a simple cleansing routine that doesn't strip your natural ph, a gentle exfoliating strategy, and regular application of sun sunscreen. this was sent as a sample for reviewing purposes and i have been using it twice a day after my skin cleansing and toning routine. i might mention, in reviewing another topical product, a similarly priced toner, some months ago, i came to the conclusion that it was a very good product, but just obscenely priced for what it accomplished and gave it a correspondingly medium rating. normally, skin seems to need to acclimate to a new product and then it takes weeks if not months to see any results, since it's the skin that repairs itself. a product only usually assists in removing the top dead skin cells and offering some rehydration to keep the cells protected and plump. that being said, after barely 2 weeks, i see  a noticeable difference in my skin, it seems more even and balanced and subtly youthful. enough so, that i decided to write this review now instead of waiting 5 or 6 weeks as i imagined would be necessary. i can't see how much its being depleted, but if it lasts anywhere near the 8 weeks it says it might last, i will purchase it again. i might mention that i regularly experiment with every type of facial acid, toners and oils like emu and even make my own vitamin c serum with ferulic acid. this skinmedica hydrator has offered the most rapid and noticeable results. it's still very expensive which is disheartening, but especially for older or dry skin, it seems so far to be offering noticeable results.",2018-05-14,5,5,A1VS1LL905P5L5,B01B3QIEPC

(2) there is a significant amount of silicone in the product. honestly, it is my fault for not paying more attention to the ingredient list, which appears in images but seems to be absent from the product description.

6028,"at first, when i ordered this product, i was concerned that i made a mistake. while i am aging and as a result, my combination skin of youth was beginning to dry out. however, i thought that this moisturizer which is advertised as a night cream would be too hydrating and make my face oily. i decided to play it safe and put on the elemis biotec skin night cream on only at night. ii actually just discovered that moisturizer helps when applying makeup but i didn't want it to be too much that my makeup slid off my face.

the first thing i noticed that it had two separate tubes inside the bottle. the green tube is the greasy oily part of the cream. the other side which is this thin whitish substance is the part that has the nutrients. now, i believe that the two pumps you need to administer to your face and neck should mix the products together. however, it doesn't, first, the oily part gets pumped into my palm and then the whitish cream blobs out separately. not only is this not eye appealing but now i have to blend it so i can properly apply it to my face. i am not sure if the bottle was created poorly that it doesn't mix together or it is intended not to mix but they don't explain anything to the customers. so after you deal with that mess, you apply it all over your face and neck which is easy with the two pumps of cream. it spreads easily and it was absorbed into my skin quickly. the best part was that my skin didn't feel greasy or sticky.  it has no overpowering odors and it actually smells nice. i noticed that after a couple of days that my skin felt smoother and softer. i am truly glad that i had the opportunity to test and review this product but for the price, it is way too expensive for me to keep buying regardless of how good this product is.",2017-09-11,4,5,A20JY8RL920U8H,B01BI6SQ96
6029,"as my skin ages, it gets more difficult to find products that keep my face moisturized and hydrated all day. elemis biotec skin cream only requires one application, in the morning or before bedtime, to keep my skin feeling soft and moisturized all day or all night. there is no skin cream that is going to get rid of every wrinkle or crease. the best skin creams can only keep the skin plumped and hydrated enough that wrinkles are smoothed and seem to disappear or at least be less noticeable. but i believe that by keeping the skin moist we can at least delay the appearance of some of the new wrinkles.

one of the biggest reasons i like this cream is that it makes my skin feel good. when my face feels dry, right after a shower, or outdoors on a cold or windy day, it makes me feel out of sorts and uncomfortable. this is advertised as a night cream, but i use it in the morning as well. why not? it absorbs easily and seems to work fine under make-up. i don't wear foundations anymore, which seem too heavy on aging skin, but a light cream to even out the tone, if needed, and a cream blush seem to work well. i just apply this about 5 minutes before putting anything else on my face to give it a chance to absorb, then apply other make-up.

the two separate chambers that dispense the cream and serum, work with one push of the pump. each side disperses a small amount. it's kind of unique and it sets it apart from other products. i like it.",2017-09-02,4,5,A3S3R88HA0HZG3,B01BI6SQ96

6032,"i have very dry skin and i've used moisturizers and creams for years. i love trying new products hoping to find "the one" that really does the job of plumping fine wrinkles and keeping my skin soft and supple. my main issue with this product is in the way that it is dispensed. it comes with two different types of liquid separated in the glass container. you are directed to use two pumps per application. i have learned from experience that you need to one-handedly (awkward) pump twice and dispense the product into the palm of your non-dominant hand. then you need to blend the two different fluids together and then apply to your face and neck area. i would much prefer that the product be already mixed so that it would be easier and more efficient to get the right mix without the extra steps.

the product has little scent, but it's pleasant and doesn't smell like chemicals. i have sensitive skin and i've not seen any hypersensitivity as the result of using it for several weeks. it seems to absorb quickly leaving a light film on my skin. as far as the diminishing of fine lines, well it works about as well as everything that i've tried. i have only been using it sparingly at night, but i believe i will try it also in the mornings before i put on my makeup.

the pump squirts out a bit of product which is just right for my morning cleanse (i only used one pump), it does not foam up which i really like as i find foaming cleansers (with the exception of fresh's foaming cleaner) really drying on my skin. it washed off very easily (no soapy feeling yay!) which i also liked as there was no unnecessary tugging action on my skin. i did not apply moisturizer after using this cleanser for the first few times to accurately judge whether it was working for me. unfortunately though my skin felt really soft and smooth after the wash, i experienced the horrible tightening and dried out feeling around half an hour after washing. i will be passing this on to my husband who has oily skin and hopefully it will work for him.",2017-08-27,3,5,A3CLHWWOVI9HMM,B01BI6SQ96

6038,"after years of struggling with acne and rosacea, i finally broken down and went to the dermatologist, who gave me some pills and creams that, for the first time, gave me luxuriously clear skin. in the effort to maintain this gorgeous skin, i've tried out numerous cleansers, moisturizers, night creams and day creams all to find "the best". i've tried l'occitane (my previous favorite), l'oreal (a much cheaper alternative to l'occitane), sheamoisture, and i think nivea, and all of them give me varying results of "okay".

at the current price of $136 on amazon, you hope that this bottle would give you the moon. and begrudgingly, i must admit that it does.

i've used it for well over a week, and my face feels amazing. soft, clear of blemishes, and perfectly moisturized. if i have a complaint, it's about the mixing of the two products - one a horrid greenish watery liquid and the other a brownish cream. the smell is a bit off-putting as well. but two pumps is all you need to coat your face and your neck - i do hope this product lasts a long time, making the brutal cost of $136 (as of 08/23/17) more palatable.

i don't know if my pocketbook will let me afford elemis - my previous favorite night cream was l'occitane, but i was balking at its $74 price tag for 1.7oz.  this product has only 1.0oz and costs even more!

update 10/09/2017: a couple of nights ago, i officially ran out of this product. so that means this 1.0oz bottle lasts approx 1-1/2 months. not nearly long enough to offset the price tag - but man, i did love the effects of this! i may have to splurge and buy another bottle.",2017-08-23,5,3,AQCQ5F0OJXMG9,B01BI6SQ96
6039,"elemis biotec skin energising, day cream.
first time trying this right out of the package only the oil side would come out
it took quite a bit of work to get the white cream side to pump out.
then now that i am able to get the full product to dispense as intended i think it needs work on the pump system.
it says to use two pumps daily. i am finding that the spout part i guess you would call it is not far enough away from the base and so much slides down the side that i find myself trying to scrape it up.
if i try to pump at an angle into my hand to combat that problem then the lotion side barely comes out.

now aside from the issue of the pump itself the product results i am pleased with so far.
the scent for me being with with allergies is just on the edge of being too strong  but i am learning to deal with it.
thankfully for me it does not linger too long.
after about ten days now i am noticing the skin on my face seems to look brighter and certainly more hydrated.
leaves my face feeling refreshed for a good part of the day.
just not sure for me that the cost would be something i could justify since i have other face creams that seem to work ok enough.",2017-08-23,3,4,A1KDM0N4UCEPHA,B01BI6SQ96
6040,"this really works and has made a noticeable difference in my skin and it's been less than two weeks. i followed the directions and two pumps at night and rub in and in the morning my skin feels soft and looks good.  it even feels good right after i apply it, but more noticeable in the morning.  i've got sensitive skin and i've experienced no irritations, sensitivities to it or breakouts. i really like how my skin feels and looks after using it, especially in the eye area and my neck.  i like that the scent is very subtle and not something that irritates me while i'm trying to go to sleep like so many other night creams do.
i think the dispensing pump on it could use improvement though because it gets messy and doesn't always come out well.  if it stops working altogether i'm not sure how i'd even get into it to get the rest of the product out.",2017-08-23,4,5,A26LD9FQHTM8ZH,B01BI6SQ96

6042,"one distinct difference that sets this lotion apart from anything that i have ever used is the method of disbursement. it comes in two separate, side by side tubes, which contain two different products. it looks like the epoxy that one would use in a workshop and is about the same size. you have to prime the pump by pressing on it twice. one side of the tube contains a white lotion and the other side contains a greenish gel. when you press the pump they come out together in your hand and you then mix the two together before applying to your skin.  it has a wonderful soft smell that tends to fade after application. i hate strong odors and smells in my cosmetics and creams and especially the ones that linger around all day and get stronger as the day goes on.  maybe its my body chemistry, but some lotions and colognes absolutely stink on me. it could be that this product has better quality ingredients and the scent is very nice. the lotion/gel combination feels wonderful on my skin. it feels very soft and luxurious to the touch and my skin feels very smooth. i like this product, but would i pay what the exorbitant price for it..nope.  made in the united kingdom.",2017-08-22,4,5,AVU1ILDDYW301,B01BI6SQ96

the packaging is not up to par for such an expensive product.  when i first opened it the plastic dispenser cover came off.  i put it back on and the first 4-5 pumps didn't give me an even distribution of both sides.

6048,"i have been using the elemis biotec skin energising, day cream, 1.0 fl. oz. on my face each morning after i take my shower and shave.  the ad on amazon tells us that elemis is scientifically proven to help increase cell energy; this day cream harnesses the patent-pending bio-energy complex of encapsulated zinc and copper.  this lotion is supposed to energize, revive, and hydrate our skin.  im not sure what energize means, but the lotion does help to make the skin on my face feel revived and hydrated.

the product comes in a bottle with two tubes side by side with a white cream in one tube and a light greenish oil in the other.  when i press on the dispenser, a tiny amount of cream and oil is released onto the palm of my hand.  the directions call for two squeezes.  now that the lotion is in the palm of my hand i rub my hands together and apply the mixture to my face.  it goes on smoothly and evenly with a light and pleasant smell and is quickly absorbed by my skin.  it does feel good.  only a tiny amount of product comes out of the pump with the two squeezes so this bottle should last a long time.

earlier i mentioned that this lotion has zinc and copper in it.  additionally, the ad tells us that the product has a moisture complex containing alisma, sodium pca, and cranberry seed oil. a trio of acids, blended with a potent phyto-bioactive and enriched with electrolytes. we need a dermatologist to evaluate the usefulness of these ingredients for the skin on our face.

this elemis day cream is expensive.  is it worth it?  each reader of this review must make that decision for himself or herself.  the only reservation i have in recommending this product is the cost; otherwise, it does appear to work as advertised.",2017-08-19,4,5,AY3AVLL5IWW9,B01BI6SQ96

6054,"update: honestly, after more use i've gotten really used to the smell. i love this product so i'm changing my review to 5 stars. this is truly the best feeling, non-drying clean my face has ever had. i use this twice a day (unless i'm doing a clay mask) and i can't wait to do it. it truly makes your skin feel awesome.

i wasn't sure what to expect with this cleaner. i find that i like what it does but i don't really care for the fragrance. it is a good cleanser and definitely gets rid of the oil on my face. i haven't noticed tightening but it's a good one to prepare your face for moisturizer.
it comes in a bottle with a pump that really doesn't squirt much out at a time. that being said this bottle will last a very long time as you only use a pump or two. wet your hand, lather and clean you face. it washes off clean and doesn't seem to dry your skin.
the fragrance reminds me of a men's lotion or aftershave. this is definitely a scent that lingers for a bit, and that would be great if you like it. i like what this product does for my skin and will continue to use it but do wish that it it didn't feel like i just applied a men's product.",2017-08-16,5,3,A2BYZFC6T5MINP,B01BI6SQ96
6055,"i ordered this product and then found it contained barley. i am a celiac and cannot use anything with wheat, barley or rye so i turned it over to my oldest daughter who is not a celiac and has no problem with gluten. i have to say that the product ingredients are so tiny...and in more than one language, so get out your magnifying glass and start reading if you want to determine ingredients contained for sensitivity reasons.

pros:
- no break-outs yet (huge pro in my book) however i like to use products for a week before i say it works for sensitive skin.
- smells nice initially
- fun to use; the two-phase pump it interesting
- definitely very  moisturizing; my skin actually feels kind of greasy and oily when i wake up in the morning...would probably be better for winter than summer for those with combo skin.
- i have noticed some reduction of wrinkles in my forehead area; probably because this is so hydroscopic it just sucks moisture in

cons:
- kind of stings when i apply it, but the sting fades quickly.
- the smell lingers and gets a bit cloying over time; while i liked it initially it is kind of distracting
- you need to keep it away from your eyes; even getting it near my eyes makes them sting.
- the two phases are very different in consistency (the green one is more liquid and the white one is thick) and they are hard to blend together evenly on face.
- price; i really love the air repair complexion boosting moisturizer even better than this one so far and that moisturizer is only $14 for a similar size.  i just can't see spending over$100 on a face cream...ever.

6058,"packaged in a two-part dispenser that reminded me of the epoxy dual-dispensers in my husband's shop - two chemicals are dispensed at the same time and in the correct proportions for the product to work as it should - "elemis biotech skin energising, day cream" may do everything the manufacturer claims it will - if the dispenser actually worked.

once i was able to open the extremely secure top, when i pumped it twice as directed i got a nice amount of cream but the oil component dribbled down the side of the bottle.  because i was never able to get any oil into my hand to mix with the cream component, i used the cream alone.  it made my skin feel soft and smooth - and it was an excellent base for my makeup.

elemis needs to make significant improvements in the dispenser in which they are packaging this day cream.  if they do not, regardless of how well the day cream works when mixed in the proper proportions, as currently packaged and dispensed the price of this product is not justified.",2017-08-15,2,5,A3MEMX0XF00TBD,B01BI6SQ96

there's a lot of scientific jargon on the bottle and box, but what it all adds up to is waking up to skin that feels vibrant and moisturized, hours after the product has been applied to the skin.  my skin feels great.

1- it is highly fragranced
2- it does tighten skin
3- it does lather; it is soapy

now, this is why i really love it:
it smells like amber and that's my favorite scent.  it's amber and herbal, and it smells very natural but it is fragrant and it does linger on the skin.  if the fragrance were bottled as a perfume, i'd want to buy it. i find it very pleasurable to use because of the fragrance.

it cleanses very well, and it leaves my skin feeling firmer and looking rosy.  not red, just rosy and healthy.  it tightens my skin, which 'irons out' some fine lines, but yet i don't find it drying.  it leaves my skin feeling very soft and hydrated.  i'm not sure how it does that, but i like it.

it's a lot of product and each use doesn't take much.  it has a nice bottle that reminds me of chanel bottles- it looks classy and it has a very nice pump that dispenses a perfect amount.  i wet my face, get a pump full, lather, put it on my face with my hands, then rinse and dry.  it's a very, very nice way to wake up and prepare for bed.",2017-08-13,5,5,A2R1HUYHXV7H18,B01BI6SQ96

the fragrance can be polarizing; if the smell of cold cream gives you nostalgia, you may like this. if you detest "old-fashioned" floral scents, you may want to pick mustela's fragrance-free baby wash.

6073,"we have 2 boys, 3 y/o and 18 mos, and have tried nearly every mustela product out there. this is no exaggeration. there are so many options this brand offers that it can be overwhelming figuring out which is best for you. first and foremost, i would recommend using mustela's baby skin diagnostic tool to determine the best product for your baby. i tried to link it, but amazon doesn't permit links to external websites, so you'll have to go to mustela's website and scroll to the applicable section.

the tool categorizes skin type into 1 of 4 categories: normal, dry, eczema prone, or very sensitive. the more sensitive and naturally derived the product, the more of a premium you're going to pay. this particular product is geared toward the very sensitive skin category. for this reason, the price is higher than a product for the normal skin type. make sure you truly need what you're purchasing. otherwise, you'll be paying a higher price for no reason. example: mustela soothing cleansing gel for sensitive skin offers 10.14 fl us oz for $11.40 (currently), but the mustela stelatopia for eczema (the most sensitive product of all) offers only 6.76 fl us oz for $11.80 (currently).

my boys had eczema when they were younger, but have seen to have mostly outgrown it. they have flare-ups from time to time, but overall, i've moved toward using this sensitive skin product on them in lieu of the stelatopia for eczema. the soothing cleansing gel is transparent, fragrance free, spreads on thinly, and barely lathers. it's very nourishing and leaves their skin smooth and supple. the cleansing gel is complemented nicely by the mustela moisturizing body lotion, which we use after drying off.

mustela's products work well, and the brand's reputation proceeds itself. this said, for a family on a budget, like ours, i rotate between using mustela and cetaphil, which can be purchased for a fraction of the cost. for very sensitive or eczema prone skin, mustela's products are worth the cost, but for skin that leans more toward normal or occasionally sensitive, it's worth switching it up for cost savings.",2017-10-13,4,4,A24YNYNC6QJNBN,B01BM67SPU

6075,"i wasn't sure if this was a lotion or a body wash. although it states neither, but as a "cleansing gel", i tested it in my hands. it felt gel-like and clear in color. i rubbed it on my hands, and there was little to no lather, and then it started to become sticky. almost like a hand sanitizer. after rubbing into my hands a little more, it felt filmy where i ran my hands under water to get a better sense of it. so i decided, maybe its best as a shower gel.

although marketed towards babies who have sensitive skin, it certainly can be used by anyone. especially those who are sensitive to the stronger soaps. this gel is hypoallergenic, and as stated on the bottle, it has 0% soap and fragrance free. it goes on easy and does not lather. i have never heard of mustela, as they are a french company, but i will pay more attention to them should i see them in the stores.",2017-10-12,4,4,A3PWPNZVMNX3PA,B01BM67SPU

6081,"this works great for my infant son with sensitive skin and i used it on both of my toddlers as well. it keeps their skin soft and has the typical mustela scent. the only issue i have with this particular product is that its name is confusing. we have many mustela products and i must admit i have grabbed this too many times and put it on as lotion since i only read the "cream" and it looks similar to all their other products. this is body wash, not lotion!",2017-08-15,4,5,A3I2NABLA9HTUP,B01BM67SPU
6082,"we use this nourishing cleansing body gel when bathing our toddlers and it cleans them really well. my oldest also commented on how he liked the smell and wanted to use it. i followed the instructions and rubbed the gel together with my hands and then on to my chidlren's skin. it went on and washed off easily. i also enjoyed the smell. it wasn't too strong but smelled clean. it seems to be helping with my children's dry skin, which is another win. we are fans of this product!",2017-07-07,5,5,A3KWR8J6CUUU63,B01BM67SPU
6083,"like others have mentioned, this body gel has a peculiar smell that isn't necessary bad, but is unexpected for a product meant to be used on little children.  i would describe the smell as old spice light, something you would expect on a 20 year old college student and it's definitely somewhat sweet.

both of my daughters have sensitive skin and this soap is gentle enough as to not give them red blotches when they get out of the bath like some of other cleansing products do.  it lathers up very well and you don't have to use a ton of it to wash hair and skin.  we use it in our hands and not to lather up a loufa so your mileage may very.

the pump mechanism works fine and seems to be high quality.  i liked that it came with a cap on it so you won't have to worry about pressure changes causing leakage if you live in high altitudes.",2017-05-14,3,5,A2M1MNG7G40V85,B01BM67SPU
6084,"i am completely in love with this product (and too many other mustela products to count since receiving them via amazon vine). the mustela nourishing cleansing body gel with cold cream for dry skin smells amazing. others might find the fragrance too strong but i liked that it lasted a long time and even overpowered the milk smell my happy little spitter develops by the end of the day!

most importantly, it didn't irritate my baby's skin in anyway. with johnson & johnson products, i found that they worsened out my baby's cradle cap after only one wash. but this mustela body gel did not irritate her skin, left baby's hair stayed soft and her hair even separated from the cradle cap on her scalp a little. other products have left baby's curls stiff and spiky but the mustela left them soft and natural!

baby's skin does feel a little softer than usual. my only complaint is that there isn't a high amount lather when used with a rag. but i did feel that the rag stayed soapy for a long time before i had to reapply. i guess i'm used to baby products that lather a lot.

i also feel better knowing this product is paraben free! it came with an attractive disposable lock in place on the spout which i thought was a nice touch because it made me feel like the product was protected during shipping. the body gel itself doesn't really have a gel consistency. it's more like hand soap- and it's similarly pearlescent. also, the bottle contains a decent amount of product so i don't feel like i will finish the bottle right away after a few uses.

overall, given that the coloration was a little dark for my blonde, blue-eyed self, i probably would not purchase again, especially given the price. i think i prefer the japanese blue-bottle biore, which sinks in immediately and provides good coverage. i can use that one on face and body.",2018-05-19,4,4,A2MBLVMVDLHK1L,B01CF4J540

as mentioned, it stayed in place when i was active and perspiring, and yet washed off at home pretty easily. it did not seem to clog my pores, and did not make my skin feel itchy. it has been reliable for me when i want to look somewhat polished and yet natural  as if all i am wearing is sunscreen, not foundation.",2017-06-30,4,3,A3KGLXW3EYDTUH,B01CF4J540
6097,"the wife and i just returned from a week-long stay at a beach resort and during that time my wife made extensive use of this obagi sun shield tint spf 50 sunscreen.

so a little setup first; my wife describes herself as pasty-white and the description isn't too far off. it's not because she's an indoors loving recluse but more related to her family lineage. prior to our vacation she'd been visiting her favorite spa to spray-tan and get a little color. during our vacation, she used the obagi tint sunscreen to essentially touch up her spray-tan and keep a nice bronze color.

she loves this sunscreen so much that she talked me into trying it and i can see why she's a fan. this sunscreen offers excellent protection (spf 50) and both she and i did not burn at all. the sunscreen goes on very easily and is a less viscous than some of the other sunscreen's we brought along and regularly use. since this product goes on so easily you'll get a nice amount of coverage per dollop of sunscreen. the tinting effect is very nice as well and goes on evenly thanks in large part to how easy the sunscreen rubs onto the skin.

i normally avoid products that offer tinting because i'm paranoid about getting the tint on my clothes. the obagi sunscreen does a great job staying put once dry. the resort we visited featured white linens and bed sheets and we didn't get any of the tint on any of those items. naturally you'll want to use some caution when using this sunscreen for the first time. i'd apply it and wash my hands immediately and then let the sunscreen dry fully before putting on clothes.

this is definitely a product my wife and i will buy and a great, easy way to get a little bit of color without having to tan. recommended!",2017-04-08,5,5,A2Q2A6JKY95RTP,B01CF4J540

i imagine that everyone nowadays knows the importance of applying broad spectrum sun protection and all the other cautions about exposure to the damaging rays. just remember, this one is not for you to rely on when out in or on the water -- you'll have to use another product then. i've used other obagi products in the past so am not surprised by the cost of this item. it should last quite awhile if used appropriately.",2017-02-14,4,3,A1WKQ94M45D8MG,B01CF4J540

6115,"obagi sun shield broad spectrum sunscreen with spf 50 in the "cool" tint is the most agreeable sunscreen i've ever used for my face, neck and chest. my dry, sensitive skin gets a bad reaction (e.g., rashes, itching, painful irritation, blisters, etc.) from most sunscreens-even those made for sensitive skin. so i'm really pleased with how obagi feels as it's non irritating and also has a creamy, comforting feel that leaves my skin feeling moisturized instead of dry or tight. also, i love that this product doesn't smell like sunscreen and is fragrance free.

the "cool" tint is a good color for my pale skin even though i consider my skin tone "neutral" with a mix of pink and olive undertones. the tint adds a hint of color that works well with my skin and looks sheer, natural and evens out my skin tone much like a quality foundation. i love how it makes my skin look and feel velvety smooth and soft. the added tint is perfect for me as i don't wear makeup when i go to the beach or for walks, so this product gives me the sunscreen coverage i need for when i get direct sun exposure and also gives me enough color to look more alive and less drab without having to wear my regular make up. it's really very nice and this product can, for me,  dual as a sunscreen and foundation when i'm going to be out in the sun.

this sunscreen is easy to apply and i don't get any streaks from the tint. i have dry skin so i apply my face cream before applying obagi sunscreen and wait to apply obagi until after my cream is fully absorbed. the obagi product is absorbed, or reaches a point where i can't wipe off any product, in about 5-10 minutes. i apply it by using large circular upsweeping motions with my fingers on my cheeks and by quickly working it into other areas like my chin and nose and smoothing it out. this product doesn't feel greasy, but it feels thick and if i apply it too soon after my face cream or apply too much, it can take awhile before i no longer feel a damp residue that shows up on a tissue if i wipe my face.

this obagi sunscreen provides excellent protection for prolonged sun exposure given that it's a broad spectrum sunscreen (provides uva and uvb protection) with a 50 spf. plus, the aesthetics of the product (tint, how easily it applies, how nice it feels, no irritation and fragrance free) are the best for me of any sunscreen i've used. it does combine physical sunblocks (zinc oxide and titanium oxide) that are considered healthier with chemical sunscreens (homosalate and octinoxate) that are fda approved and widely-used, but may be hormone disrupters. with cosmetics, it seems there's always some downside, but i think this is a great sunscreen that's superior to others i've used over the years so i'm rating it 5 stars.",2017-02-09,5,5,A2L6BT1PVV9YN0,B01CF4J540
6116,"obagi's sun shield tint... etc. turned out to be a decent sun screen for the few days we recently spent in southern florida - winter time. it was good because the gulf's waters aren't too warm in january son nobody thought of swimming but we tried it on our faces while walking/jogging on the beach and... no sunburns.

the claims of it being non-comedogenic (does not block your skin's pores) and hypoallergenic are validated. our teenage daughter was able to wear it and it did not trigger acne. my skin happens to be allergic to fragrances but this sunscreen was good that way. the active ingredients (google them up) are homosalate (not a salad), octinoxate, titanium dioxide and zinc oxide.

the obagi... etc. was all good in this particular place at this particular time of the year. however, if you are planning to use it in the summer and your plans for that day involve swimming or sweating, think again. the product washes off easily and the advice on the box is to "user a water resistant sunscreen if swimming or sweating." i suppose the obagi could still be a good sunscreen solution while hiking or in a place and time such as south florida in january, especially if acne is one of your skin conditions and you don't mind the exorbitant price.",2017-02-04,3,3,ADLVFFE4VBT8,B01CF4J540

the ritual of hamman body cream, however, is as easy to spread and smooth over your skin as lighter lotions, which is another plus.  and my arms and legs continue to feel smooth and not dry for hours after applying it.  i really like the fragrance, too; the combination of eucalyptus and rosemary gives it a refreshing, pleasant smell that is not overpowering and gender neutral.  recommend highly.",2018-07-13,5,5,A14L2638XC00EZ,B01CP39HMG

so how did it perform? on my hands it absorbed 100% and immediately which acted more like a lotion than a skin creme, but my bare hands are used for things like cooking, dishwashing, cleaning, doing ceramics, making art, so they need more moisture than this can provide. on the hands this left no barrier afterwards, it was all absorbed instantly, i need something more and usualy a creme provides that. that is why i say this acts more like a lotion. on my body it sunk it but left some on the surface as a barrier. because this is more like a lotion and due to the size to price ratio i didn't feel this was worth the cost, especially since it's a regular creme not a medical - spa grade treatment product, rating 3 stars = it's okay. also it is so strong i worried it would bother other people in public, in the interview i attended and in my college class and i didn't want to be that intrusive with my body fragrance.",2018-06-30,3,3,A3SMR4HRFJARSC,B01CP39HMG

6166,"one thing that i really enjoy using is a good exfoliating salt scrub when it is made with natural ingredients.  let's see how this measures up.

what is this like?
this salt scrub is made with fine himalayan salt.  it comes in a red plastic jar and is sealed.  it has some oil in it, but mostly salt, so it is not over-oily.  the smell is delicious.  although it has some artificial fragrance, it does not gag me or make me prefer a natural one instead.

how does this perform?
when using this in the shower with dampened skin, i found that i only need a teaspoon for my arms and a little more than that for each leg.  the salt is very fine and it does scrub well.  it is not overly oily, but it does seal the skin nicely, creating a moisturizing effect.  the fragrance is very lovely.  it stays on long enough to make me feel special, but is not so strong that people recoil when they encounter me after a shower.

any bad reactions?
there have been no bad reactions to this at all.

moisturizing?
the moisturizing lasts for me all day and into the next day although it is summer and i don't have as hard of a time as winter for dryness.

the bottom line
for a beautifully fragrant experience that feels royal and naturally but gently exfoliates the skin, this scrub is really lovely.  more natural in composition than some scrubs, it is a very rich experience.

my rating
i give this five stars.  i would purchase this again.  it would be even more luxurious in winter time when i love rich smelling natural leaning products.",2018-08-05,5,5,AWIF8AR75LL9L,B01CP39FL4
6167,"this review is for the ayurveda variety.

i personally quite like the scent of the ayurveda scrub as it does have a calming effect with me, and it seems to work well as a scrub.  i do need to dip into the jar to get salt about four or five times to cover my body, but that seems reasonable to me.

it would be nice if the salt stayed together a bit better as i was transferring it from the jar to my skin.  the salt doesn't really stick together that well, so it wants to fall off of my fingers.

related to that - i took a star away because i also ordered a smaller jar of this same scrub, and the two jars have different consistencies.  this larger jar has more liquid in it (the oil mentioned in the description, i presume), whereas the smaller jar is more dry and seems more like compacted salt.  i only have the two jars to go by, so i'm not sure if other jars differ as much, too.  the salt in this one stays together better because there's more oil to bind it, but the grains are still kind of loosely held together.

it works really well to make my skin feel better, and the scent is soothing to me.  i ultimately really like the end effect, but i would like the scrub to be more consistent from jar to jar, as well as be easier to apply.",2018-08-04,4,4,A1J5HIF41ENSMZ,B01CP39FL4

6169,"the most interesting aspect of this body scrub is the feeling that it leaves on the skin.  typical soaps rid the skin of oil and leave it with a tightness or astringency that might make one want to moisturize afterwards.  this scrub, however, leaves the skin feeling clean yet moisturized at the same time.  admittedly, that characteristic took a bit of getting used to.  it's not objectionable, just different.

with regard to the fragrance--sweet orange and cedar wood--i couldn't say with certainty that it did or did not smell like what's on the label, but i did like the scent along with its potency.  a welcome change.

the consistency of the scrub is reminiscent of white sugar combined with a water-oil solution . . . but the sugar doesn't dissolve.  good to use on a weekend after doing yard work all day and you're looking for a spa moment when cleaning up.",2018-08-01,4,4,A3T6HX48F66512,B01CP39FL4

sodium chloride, ethylhexyl stearate, caprylic/capric triglyceride, parfum/fragrance, argania spinosa (kernel) oil, macadamia integrifolia seed oil, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba seed) oil, prunus persica (peach) kernel oil, olea europaea (olive fruit) oil, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, mentha piperita (peppermint) oil, rosa centifolia extract, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, menthol, tocopherol, isopropyl myristate, benzyl benzoate, citronellol, coumarin, hexyl cinnamal, linalool, butylphenyl methylpropional, limonene.

it works well and it not too abrasive.  use with plenty of water and try a little first to make sure you don't react to it.  some people get very red/blotchy using these products.

i did not find it abrasive nor did it cause a reaction and my family has lots of fair and sensitive skin.

has a very soothing scent!",2018-07-31,4,5,A3T4OHEAHOJ700,B01CP39FL4
6171,"i read other reviews before trying out my rituals of ayurveda body scrub.

i saw that some reviews commented on the roughness of the salt. i thought "my skin is tough, this shouldn't be an issue". so, when i used my body scrub, i used too much pressure. please make sure to scrub gently, the salt granules really are rough!

the smell is nice, and the scrub left my skin feeling soft.",2018-07-30,4,3,A26UNIPEVYE9DE,B01CP39FL4
6172,"i really like this scrub! i use it mainly on my arms where i have bumps & this seems to help soften them & make them less noticeable. i think this is high quality & enjoy using it to pamper myself! the smell is ok, but  a little strong for me.

6173,"this is a sea salt scrub with large salt crystals so it is a typical rough exfoliation sensation. as with all salt scrubs the salt sinks to the bottom and the oils pool at the top so you have to stir it up with your fingers before use. the fragrance is eucalyptus, i could not detect any ginger. it is marketed to give the skin a warming feel from the ginger but i did not detect any warming sensation or ginger fragrance at all. this is a spa like experience you can do at home. the shower floor needs to be washed after as it leaves a layer of oil which is a slip and fall hazard for the next user of the shower. i think it is overpriced compared to other salt scrubs on the market to be honest. for the price value and the lack of ginger experience as this promises to deliver i am rating it 3 stars = it's okay.",2018-07-25,3,3,A3SMR4HRFJARSC,B01CP39FL4
6174,"has a wonderful, exotic smell to it.  not overly floral.  i liked it at first but as i continued to use it, i liked the smell more and more.  the salt does a great job of exfoliating skin, and as it dissolved, made for a nice bath soak for my tired muscles too.  at first i thought the scrub was too dry but i am glad i resisted adding a bit of light sesame oil to it, because once i rinsed the salt off it left my skin just the right level of moisturized, super soft and silky without feeling too greasy.  the tub was easy to clean out afterwards, no heavy greasy film left behind.  i took off one star because i think the salt is a little too coarse but most importantly because it seemed to have an odd menthol feeling.  i was sitting in a hot bath but everywhere i had used the scrub my skin felt cool, like when you use a cream for sore muscles that has menthol in it.  it wasn't irritating, but it did keep me from having that really pleasant hot feeling that i look for when taking a long, hot, relaxing bath.  perhaps it would be better used as a pick-me-up scrub in the morning.",2018-07-22,4,4,AD1ZOPB0BBEHB,B01CP39FL4
6175,"after trying a coffee body scrub which left my shower a total coffee-ground covered mess, and another one which took me a week to clean up the grease, i was a little leery about trying another scrub.

im really glad i took a chance. the rose/almond fragrance is delightful and if left my bod feeling silky smooth. im not sure it helped to balance the body, mind and soul but it is very pleasant. like all cosmetics, i think they get a little carried away with the advertising  hype but thats just the way it is.

the instructions say to use once or twice a week and i look forward to it.

6176,"this is a lovely addition to a bath: it has a bright, clean fragrance and it does what it's supposed to (light, cleansing exfoliation) without being abrasive. how i wish the same were true for most of the people in my life! this will have a constant place on the edge of my bathtub, not only because its packaging is so darned attractive, but also because it cleans so gently, so fragrantly, and so well.",2018-07-21,5,5,A2XAQOWHRPY98K,B01CP39FL4
6177,"rituals body scrub comes in a pretty containers. the color is unique and the texture is surprising. it feels very rough to the touch, yet i was shocked that it didn't hurt when you applied it to your body. it leaves your skin feelings smooth and refreshed. love that it is make with natural products. a huge plus.

6178,"as much as i hate when people use the word delicious to describe anything but foodthis scrub is delicious. i subscribed to an embarrassing number of beauty boxes for a couple of years, so ive tried all manner of fancy, expensive body products, and im usually underwhelmed. scrubs in particular seldom impress, because they're so easy to make it home (salt or sugar base, oils, plus other additives like oatmeal etc.), but this one is amazing. its so luxurios feeling and smelling, the experience is true decadence. the balance between the scrub and the oily vehicle is perfect, and it doesnt have that utilitarian feel of homemade and most commercial scrubs (im not describing this well, but the bottom line is that it doesnt perform like something i could make myself with ingredients in my pantry and bathroom).

though its a salt scrub, it didn't irritate the many scrapes and scratches on my legs, unusual for a salt scrub (and why i lean toward sugar scrubs). it left my skin soft and hydrated, but didn't leave me greasy or leave behind a slick coating in my shower.

but the really unique part of this scrub is the scent. generally speaking, i wish every single product i use was unscented instead of scented the way it is. rituals brand is one of the few consistent exceptions. ive tried many of their scents through beauty boxes, and they're all very different and all very good. this one is rich and exotic but not overwhelming or cloying, just decadent.

just as a sidenote, i hate all that marketing nonsese about purifying sea salt and this scrub purifying body and soul. huh? my souls is pure now? thats a neat trick. _ but its definitely a bath treat lavish enough to qualify as a little bit of sensory self-care.

finally, this scrub stands up on its own. not one to engage in multi-step beauty rituals if any kind (who has that kind of time or cash?), i don't preceed/follow this with the recommended 3 additional products, and i am perfectly delighted. i simply shower as usual, then use the scrub and rinse afterwards, no additional wash or moisturizer necessary. (but it is summer, and our humidity is so high that my skin, which is like the cryptkeepers in winter, isn't super needy right now.)",2018-07-19,5,5,A2RQOO8VYAEZZG,B01CP39FL4
6179,"just like other rituals products, i love this body scrub.  the salts are very large and the oil is light but moisturizing.  the scent is complementary to other rituals products, which i love.  it has a spa-like aroma.  my only problem is screwing/unscrewing the lid when my hands are wet and i managed to slice my fingers on the edge of the lid and draw blood, so my only complaint is find a closing mechanism that it easier to handle in a shower/bath setting where hands are wet and slippery.  but 100% recommend the product inside the jar!",2018-07-15,5,5,ASJ0MKRFZC47B,B01CP39FL4
6180,"the smell of this scrub is just divine. it is clean and fresh smelling but not overpowering.  i regularly use an exfoliating product and i like to switch them up since using the same thing every day tends to make the products not have as strong as an effect.  this is definitely going into my rotation of hempz, bath and body works sugar scrub and a scrub made by my esthetician.  i use the scrubs every other day since i have sensitive skin and the use of scrubs really helps to get rid of the dry dead skin and allow the moisturizer i use to really soak in.  the sugar crystals used in this scrub last long enough to do the job, then just disintegrate.  i am so glad that more companies are using environmentally safe components in their scrubs since the use of the plastic balls ends up in the ecosystem and really causes damage to fish and other wildlife.",2018-07-15,5,5,A2TBZAC0XYHLIB,B01CP39FL4
6181,"i really do like this body scrub. there is no warming sensation they talk about in the description, but it is a luxurious scrub (if you don't mind a heavier menthol type scent). i like the scent because both i and my husband can use it as it's neither feminine or masculine (and everyone needs to exfoliate regardless of gender). it definitely leaves a clean, refreshed feeling to your skin without any gross residue. i have very sensitive skin and it didn't irritate me at all, which is another huge plus as it's hard for me to find exfoliating scrubs that don't irritate my skin. if you don't mind a scent that has heavy menthol to it and you want a unisex body scrub that works well i highly recommend this.",2018-07-14,4,5,A1TPWGBNIYJ76F,B01CP39FL4
6182,"rituals the ritual of sakura body scrub, 13.2 ounce is a top quality product at a price that is much less than other scrubs of similar quality. i had tried the ayurveda gift set that has the shower foam, shower oil, shampoo, and body cream and they were so good that i decided to try this scrub as well. it works really well leaving your skin soft and well conditioned.

all of the products in this line that i have tried i have been very pleased with. rituals the ritual of sakura body scrub, 13.2 ounce is recommended.",2018-07-14,5,5,A33SX0AD5PYD9B,B01CP39FL4
6183,"i had to rate this product 4 stars because it doesn't quite deliver on all that it promised. it doesn't product a warming sensation at all. it also is a little too heavy on the mentholatem or eucalyptus scent (read: vicks vapo rub). i guess that makes the product more unisex than a flowery scent, but they could have used something more pleasant, like lavender, which can be used for both sexes. at least it cleared up my sinuses!

other than the scent, the product is very nice. it definitely leaves you feeling clean and refreshed as a scrub. it has just the right amount/size of particles, so it doesn't overtax and irritate the skin. it's a decent product at a decent price, but i won't be purchasing it again because of the strong scent (which is a personal preference).",2018-07-13,4,3,A29VG90T649CSU,B01CP39FL4
6184,"i've used salt scrubs in the past.  they have been creamy with gritty salts throughout.  this one is different.  feels like it's just salt.  all grainy without out any creamy filter.  it certainly feels like it's grinding away those dead skin cells.  it smells awesome and i like how my skin feels after i rinse it off.  it does have a nice "tingle" to it and this may be weird thing to say, but has a good taste if you get some on your lip.",2018-07-12,4,4,A235NA61RC6YC1,B01CP39FL4
6185,"this review is for the rituals the ritual of sakura body scrub, 13.2 ounce.
this scrub features indian rose and sweet almond oil.

the oil isn't overly scented with rose and has a pleasant scent, almost a triple milled soap scent with undertones of rose and the pink salt.

the salt is a visible ingredient in this scrub.  it isn't overly coarse and not too fine either.  it gently exfoliates without being irritating to skin.

no adverse reactions, smooth skin.  i would recommend this scrub.",2018-07-12,5,3,A1BK60GZ4QME6I,B01CP39FL4
6186,"this was a well received scrub here.  she loved the feeling when applying it.  she described it as a wet sugar consistency.  unlike some other scrubs, it's not too harsh to be overly abrasive and irritating, but it also doesn't fall short like some others have and be basically useless for the purpose.

goes on well, scrubs well, and she also liked the scent.  it's a win/win all around.",2018-07-12,4,4,ABQWMANK4AR63,B01CP39FL4
6187,"i just took a shower and used this body scrub. my skin feels softer, i don't see the flakes of dry skin on my legs and arms and i am pretty sure i smell better (it might be the deodorant, not sure). while in the shower, i scrubbed my entire body. now i didn't feel any warmth, burning or any other issues and i have eczema and psoriasis. if i were to have an issue with the product, i am pretty sure i would have had it by now. but i only feel scrubbed clean. i used it everywhere except private areas that would be more tender. i would love to try the entire hammam ritual - especially when i can have some me time and relax in the jacuzzi tub.",2018-07-11,4,3,A25QBCHO0KFT0P,B01CP39FL4
6188,"indulge in a salt scrub once or twice a week to exfoliate skin, especially on your legs, feet, and elbows.  love the ruby red --too pretty to hide in a cupboard-- and the almond and rose scent.  not too fragrant, fortunately.",2018-07-10,5,5,APCSV85SWASN2,B01CP39FL4
6189,"i find the subtle orange & cedar scent of this scrub so comforting; i gravitate to woody & spicy scents, so for me its perfect. i use the sugar scrub weekly, its fabulous for a general body scrub but i especially like to use it as part of my weekly foot pampering after filing.

i love the light veil of scented oil that remains on my skin, even after towel drying. the softness and scent linger all day and leaves my skin feeling silky and hydrated. i had to buy the shower oil so my skin could feel that way every day!",2018-07-08,5,5,A2ZJMLZ1IA2YA9,B01CP39FL4

6191,"this worked well as a scrub - i felt like it exfoliated my skin well. i still needed to apply moisturizer after my shower but i have very dry skin so it might be moisturizing enough by itself for some people. the fragrance was way to strong. when my husband came home from work several hours after my shower, he thought i had cleaned the house because the whole house smelled like the scrub! it stayed on my skin until the next day and my shower smelled like it for days. i like a more subtle smell to my beauty products!",2018-07-06,3,5,AVL5IDEE8YA3D,B01CP39FL4
6192,"this body scrub is lovely. it smells great and exfoliates well. it has oil as an ingredient, so after the shower, water just beads right off of you and there is really no need for lotion afterward. that is great! but, the oil gets on the shower floor and makes it very slippery. so that is a major precaution. don't fall down!!",2018-07-03,4,5,A2L9OPJAAEK08Q,B01CP39FL4
6193,"easy to use and has a nice exfoliating action.

the scent is a bit strong, and while it is supposed to be a warm wood and orange scent, is more perfumey than i would like.

i enjoyed it, but my daughter hated the scent and refused to try it.",2018-07-01,4,3,A2X61KKXXR6WNP,B01CP39FL4
6194,"im a big proponent of exfoliation (it makes your skin look fresh and youthful) and im glad i got a chance to try this sweet orange & cedar wood scrub from rituals.  like most scrubs its a bit oily when you first apply it, but once youve rinsed and dried your skin you don't feel at all greasy.  this product leaves your skin feeling soft, smooth and lightly moisturized.

fragrance is entirely subjective, but i like the way this scrub smells.  the scent is citrusy and invigorating and, once youve dried off, you just get a subtle whiff of fragrance.  very nice.

if your skin is sensitive or reacts to fragrance you should probably patch test this before doing an all-out scrub, but i think this will probably work for most skin types.  **note** this can leave your tub slick and slippery, so be cautious.  enjoy!",2018-06-28,4,5,A1XCSAX4BRT89Y,B01CP39FL4
6195,"this scrub is really luxurious. the oil makes my skin feel amazing. the scent is really nice. its kind of a hassle to use in the shower (if someone could come out with a flip top for body scrub that would be amazing), but it makes my skin so smooth and hydrated that it is so worth it.",2018-06-27,5,5,A47Q26DA5037K,B01CP39FL4
6196,"this jar is larger than i was expecting, at 13.2 ounces. the red jar is plastic, while the lid has a brushed copper look (it's not copper, just looks like it). the jar was sealed with foil underneath the lid. the smell is divine! i really like it. reminds me of something aveda might produce, very earthy and natural. it says it's sweet orange and cedar wood, but it does not have a strong citrus smell (which is good, as that can end up smelling like cleaning products) but the two scents play so nicely together.

upon use the product is very gentle, while also a great exfoliant. the rich oils leave the skin feeling very moisturized and dewy. overall, this product has a very luxurious, high-end feel with an amazing scent. it would make a great addition to any spa, bath routine, or gift!",2018-06-20,5,5,A2E3NAL9ECE7VS,B01CP39FL4
6197,"i really like the scent of this ritual as it's not too strong, is masculine without being heavy, but is present. the consistency reminds me of a frozen drink that has melted a bit, so it's somewhat messy and you're better off opening it in the shower. there's a good amount of oil in the product so note that it's just like using baby oil in the shower in that it will not easily rinse away. feels great on the skin and is very moisturizing for the summer. i've moved mine to an outdoor shower so i won't have to worry about clean up.",2018-06-19,4,5,A7UPJYPAH73NC,B01CP39FL4
6198,"i love the way this smells and not only that, the smell lasts in the bathroom for hours.  i've used many scrubs in the past and i've used many scents that have the boho gypsy aroma, and this has it all.  it feels luxurious against the skin and not scratchy at all.  my husband says it feels like fine sand paper, this is his very first scrub ever.  he complained that it didn't have any lather but that is the nature of scrubs.  admittedly, i do use unscented dove soap to get a good lather in the washrag, and then heap on a dollop of this scrub.  the reason for one star taken away is that the exfoliating features that make this so wonderful do not last very long.  as soon as i've gotten to the bottom half of my body, i have to get another dollop.  still i would continue buying for that heavenly scent! love it!",2018-06-18,4,3,A2H2FT8WV5X6SV,B01CP39FL4
6199,"i figured this would smell like real, nature orange and cedar, but it absolutely does not! yuck, it is very perfumey, fake-o smelling. i think if they would have used real essential oils it could have been much nicer. i didn't use it because i didn't want to reek of perfume!

i think the ingredients are very good, except the perfume. i have found making my own satisfies me the most. just take sugar and coconut oil, mix and add my own essential oils.

as a amazon vine reviewer, i receive this product for free and provided my honest opionion of the product.",2018-06-18,1,5,A3AHDR4F2J7YXX,B01CP39FL4
6200,"ritual of the happy buddha body scrub is a white granulated mixture of sugar (sucrose), and oils including cedar and bark extracts, safflower oil, almond extract, citrus, macademia nut oil, etc..  the container states that it contains no parabens (waxes), mineral oils, or 'plastic scrub', which i assumes means no micro beads.  the scrub separates out with a lot of liquid on the top.  using a plastic spoon, i was able to re-homogenize the scrub, but after a few minutes, it started to separate again.  overall, this is an effective scrub, and easy to apply.  it took about 5 tablespoons to do one person.  my wife had an allergic reaction, possibly to the scrub, on one thigh.  since this does contain plant/tree extracts, some people may have an allergic reaction.  overall recommended, for those with no allergies to the ingredients.",2018-06-18,4,5,A3TCMJ6GKZJFBQ,B01CP39FL4
6201,"i enjoy body scrubs, and this one has a nice scent of cedar and sweet orange, very uplifting smell.  nice big jar, leaves your skin feeling soft and hydrated.  the oils tend to stay on your skin longer than i like, but i'll get over it.  as for body scrubs this is a really nice one,",2018-06-17,5,5,AUCXT9K30SHYF,B01CP39FL4
6202,"a bit pricey for something that gets used up a bit too fast, but cooling and soothing makes you feel really fresh after a shower.  i have used axe and other body scrubs, and i like to use them after i exfoliate with a brush and a good soap.  exfoliation is the best way to get clean in the bath or shower.  one of the things i learned on a scientific tv special years ago was that showering with hot or warm water actually encourages bacterial growth.  i was confused then how you'd keep from being eaten alive by microbes or why we all didn't stink to high heaven after a warm bath.  the answer is soap and other things that scrub away the skin which then carries the bacteria down the drain.  when i first use soap and get the basic grime off my skin when rubbed starts to ball up little bits to wash off.  a good body wash will cleanse that, even more and leave a good clean base behind.  it might even do you some good to run cool water when you're done to get the remaining bacteria to stop multiplying.

after a good soaping, and rinse this compound with some cooling and cleaning and other protective ingredients makes the skin feel fresh and alive. the scent is fantastic, but i question a bit the use of sugar in the compound.  maybe it doesn't matter because pure sugar won't create bacterial growth, the question is will it in combination with skin cells give them something to eat, or is it inhibited by the other ingredients.  after a couple uses, i've noticed it lasts a long time even in the heat, so i don't suspect the sugar does much to make it bad.  on the happy buddha, it the jar talks of his smiling journeys and people rubbing his big tummy for luck.  i had an interesting experience taking a japanese saturday school class.  at the presentation event where each class does various plays, readings, singing or other presentations, they hold a lunch afterwards with lots of japanese food from the parents and from patron businesses.  i was sitting there eating some sort of curry dish when a little kid came up to me, looked me right in the eye and rubbed my stomach (which is somewhat large).  i wondered what the heck was going on till one of the instructors said it's good luck in japan to rub the bellies of sumo wrestlers.  i think that's an offshoot of the happy buddha maybe as the body shapes are similar.  recommended, for a clean and invigorating feeling after bath or shower.",2018-06-17,4,3,A39LRLKACX89IP,B01CP39FL4
6203,"this is a really good size tub of body scrub. i love the feel of the sugar and oils, but the scent , though pleasant, is a bit strong. my only peeve with it is that the oils, while feel great in the shower, tend to leave my skin feeling a bit too oily for my liking, after using it , i ended up using a bosy wash over my skin to take away some of that feeling my skin is not that dry that i need the extra oil, otherwise a great beauty product that did leave my skin soft. i probably will only use it maybe once a week.",2018-06-16,4,4,A5ZD6FBMZQGDS,B01CP39FL4

it's light and refreshing with a hint of rose fragrance combined with a touch of something else (honey)? and it smells really expensive.",2018-07-12,5,5,AWPN47SSWK1JV,B01CP39M4O
6206,"this as a pleasant surprise.  this was a new brand to her, and the scent was just about perfect - pleasing but not cloying, noticeable but still quite subtle.  so many other similar products are a bit jarring, when you get in range of the scent it's like you walked through a wall.  this is quite the opposite, and she loves the smell.",2018-07-12,5,5,ABQWMANK4AR63,B01CP39M4O
6207,"this is a great scent. i spray on my clothes and hair but avoid spraying directly on my skin as it is a bit strong.

6208,"i generally prefer more natural scents, light florals, musks, fruits, and spice. this falls into that category and i am enjoying it. it is pretty strong when you first spray it but the strength isn't long lasting and it dissipates relatively quickly.  a softer version is left, which is appealing and soothing to me. being water based, it's safe to use on fabrics.

i'm still deciding if i like this enough to purchase more, but first impressions are good. it's pretty pricey at around $25 for 1.6 oz..",2018-08-16,4,4,A26BU3ZU0R5IPF,B01CP39M4O

6210,"i tried happy buddha and it has a citrus, woodsy smell that reminds me a lot of the spas and temples in thailand or... well, this is probably bad... but it gives me a warm fuzzy feeling because it reminds me of when my mom would polish our teak wood furniture with orange smelling wood cleaner.... or of the oranges and incense of my mother's home temple.  so, its not a bad scent... its just not a scent that i would spray on me.  when i did spray it on me, there was no lasting power and it dissipated within 15 minutes. with that said, i will probably use it as an air freshener for my office, bathroom, or bedroom. now, i have not tried their other scents so i am unsure how the others smell, but i assume they also do not have have any staying powder and you would have to reapply throughout the day....",2018-08-13,3,3,A3VP3TSPGYRR65,B01CP39M4O

6213,"so strange! when i first squirt it it smells so strong and not good. i left it on my arm and it turned out to smell so sweet. everyone liked it after that. it does fade after about an hour. i know these ingredients are not all natural. i won't use it on my hair. i put too many different scents on my hair, after washing, and moose and hair spray another scent would be too much.",2018-08-12,3,5,A39BGN8JA7CIFX,B01CP39M4O
6214,"this is gong to be a rather subjective review. when it comes to fragrances people either tend to like them or hate them. that's what this fragrance is like. it's a bit strong so if you don't like strong fragrances you're not going to like this. on the other hand, if you like stronger, uplifting fragrances this is perfect. it almost smells as if it has a hint of cinnamon and other spices and an apple undertone. that's just me. any fragrance you use on your hair or body is going to interact with your own chemistry and you'll either love the smell or hate it. in my opinion, this is a great scent for those frumpy, tired days when you need an uplifting fragrance to enhance your mood and make you smell good. i especially like it after being around someone who has been smoking or other odors that tend to stick to your hair, clothes, and skin. this takes care of the lingering odor right away. also, a little goes a long way with this product. one or two spritzes and you're done. don't overdo it or you'll be regretting it for hours as the fragrance lasts quite a while.",2018-08-12,4,5,A1TPWGBNIYJ76F,B01CP39M4O
6215,"this is a hair and body mist that is water-based.  it doesn't stain or leave an oily residue on clothing, so it's safe to spray on textiles as well. it's also healthier for the environment and your body as it's a natural product using orange and cedar wood scents. note: no mineral oil or parabens are found in this body mist.

i really liked the scent and found it instantly soothing.  i tend to like scents that are similar to 'musk', jasmine or utilize sandalwood as a general preference.

my daughter didn't like this scent at all.  she likes scents like cherry blossom, eucalyptus, and patchouli. **i give you this info in hopes that it can help you decide if this scent is for you.

being water-based, this scent dissipates quickly and needs to be reapplied throughout the day to maintain its aroma.  if applied to freshly washed, moisturized skin, the scent stays a bit longer.

this body-hair mist added an instant lift to my mood when i sprayed it on.  i wish the scent lasted longer, but i do appreciate that it is oil-free and won't stain fabrics.  orange is the primary scent with subtle cedar undertones.  i think this product would be good for men or women.",2018-08-12,4,5,A12DQZKRKTNF5E,B01CP39M4O

6223,"the rituals the ritual of ayurveda body mist is a 1.6 ounce body mist that comes in a glass spray bottle.  it sprays a fine mist, & it is highly fragrant so a little goes a long way.  the first time i tried it i sprayed it on my hand, because i have sensitivities to flowery scents & i wasn't sure how the cedar wood would be?  first spray will make you smile if you love orange. it has a sweet, orange smell that smells wonderful! it's fruity, & smells great. i didn't smell anything "woodsy" like you would expect a cedar wood to smell like.  i was surprised i liked this as much as i did.  it's listed as a hair & body mist, & while i've never tried a mist for your hair (besides the smell of hair spray, gels, & products specifically made for hair styling), i think this is a nice body mist.

i would recommend this for those who enjoy the smell of sweet orange.

remember- a little goes a long way, & the scent stays for awhile, so you only need a little at a time. the bottle will last awhile.

4/5 stars.

if it were strictly sweet orange, without the cedarwood included, it would be a solid 5 stars. ;)",2018-08-05,4,5,AK3402G7FO7AY,B01CP39M4O
6224,"though the scent of this is both rose and honey, the rose definitely dominates. in fact, i couldn't smell any honey tones at all, but my best guess is that it mainly cuts through the cloying overly floral scent of pure rose. i found this to be more potent than expected for a body spray or something designed to be sprayed on a bed, but i guess it was made to fade over time, but still leave a vague presence. for my part, i found it too intense for use on my body, but fine as something sprayed onto clothing or into a room.

while this is strong for my tastes, i did note that it doesn't have any sharp, artificial smells or any alcohol scent. it smelled pretty natural to me. i also loved the beautiful packaging and the dark glass bottle that will stop sunlight from interacting with it.",2018-07-26,4,4,A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV,B01CP39M4O
6225,"i am suspicious of this product. i have followed ayurvedic practices for awhile and central to ayurveda is determining one's dosha. is this for pittas? vadas? kaphas? is it tri-doshic? or, is the manufacturer capitalizing on the popularity of ayurveda and using conventional perfume making ingredients with a "natural" scent? it does not smell natural at all, but like a commercial perfume. a quick look at the rituals site reveals that the ayurveda line is only one of six scent lines, all with an eastern theme. one of the ingredients, cyclohexene, is on osha hazard lists. it does contain some natural ingredients, but since ayurveda is about balancing your energy naturally, why spray yourself with a mist created in a chemist's lab? be your own advocate and if you're attracted to ayurveda, don't fall prey to slick marketing tactics supported by pretty prose and photographs. keep it simple, keep it natural.",2018-07-22,1,5,A1FMWLZ9YY91XI,B01CP39M4O

6228,"i'm not huge on body fragrances but the smell of this interested me. it's a very sweet smell so if you're not okay with that then this will not be for you. it says indian rose and honey and that is exactly what i can smell. the scent is like an exotic rose and if you think about it when you're smelling it you can get honey from it as well. i've decided that i do like to miss this on my body as its subtle and it doesn't last a really long time. i have also decided that misting my linen with this, as in my bed linens, is not for me. it is too sweet to try and sleep with.

it has a pump sprayer and it really is a very fine mist when you spray it. i can't imagine using more than a couple of pumps at a time. the bottle is made of glass and is pretty heavy. from visiting a perfumery in france before i believe i did learn that plastic and light can be enemies of perfumes so this make sense. overall, this is pretty delightful and we will definitely get use in my home.",2018-07-18,4,5,A2BYZFC6T5MINP,B01CP39M4O

scents, of course, are a matter of personal preference.  the product is a good quantity and comes in a nice glass bottle.",2018-07-17,2,3,A3E0W5O1MPW3K,B01CP39M4O

for me it's kind of hard to describe the scent which is supposed to be indian rose and himalaya honey, but i will say that whatever it is keeps me wanting to smell it throughout the day.  in the end isn't that what you want a body mist to do?  the scent is there but it's not overpowering, which i hate. i want to smell it, i don't want to drown in it!",2018-07-13,5,5,APP35M28G2U51,B01CP39M4O

6275,"all hail the queen was my first bottle of polish by butter london. tired of thin polishes from essie and not really excited by opi at the moment, i finally decided to give this brand a try. i've purchased a bottle of chanel polish before, but $15 for nail color still seems steep to me. i picked this color because it seemed safe lol and i just wanted to try the product line.

i really do like the color. having brown skin it's not exactly nude but a nice neutral color with a hint of sparkle to break up the monotony. the application reminded me a lot of the chanel bottle i have. not just the removable top cover, but the fact that it brushes on neatly. you won't end up with too much on the brush, minimizing clean up and product waste.

the color itself is nice and with a top coat it reminds me a little of those old sally hansen prism polishes, minus the color change effect. i do like the texture of the polish and it's wearable with or without a topcoat. this color can also be worn well at one or two coats. the drying time was fast, but i can't speak too much for the longevity yet. i see complaints about chipping polish, which may be solved by making sure your nails are smooth, well buffed and totally clean of all oils. after a day of wear, shampooing my hair etc my polish was still intact, at least. (i used out the door topcoat)

i'm not saying i'm a butter london fan just yet lol, but i did like this polish enough to order a second color. when i saw my polish outdoors the next day, i ordered 3 more bottles of butter london polish from amazon lol. while i'm sure other companies out there make a color comparable to this one, i'm happy i finally gave this brand a try.",2013-12-05,5,3,A2Q3BW3177V542,B01DQG3DFI

6278,"i was so excited to pick out my very first bottle of butter 3-free nail polish. there were many gorgeous colors to choose from. i chose this one (kerfuffle)...and i wish i hadn't. it didn't go on very nicely. it was obvious i couldn't even possibly get by temporarily with one coat. but mostly it reminds me of a colored "white-out" i used years ago at my job. every time i look down at my toes, i cringe because it's obvious i won't be happy until i remove it and put something else on.

i would be willing to try another color by this brand, but i can't recommend this one.",2013-09-20,2,5,A3DPA9ARQYFJYR,B01DQG3DFI
6279,"my first bottle of butter london nail polish is a gorgeous mauve-pink shade with pearlescent/metallic overtones.  the bottle wouldn't open until i saw that it was sealed with a special sticker and you have to pull off the cute rectangular top to get at the real top that unscrews to reveal the brush.  clever!  also no leaks.

the polish goes on like the name states, like butter.  i used o.p.i. natural nail base coat, then two coats of the polish, topped off by o.p.i. rapid dry top coat.  because the butter london polish self-levels very nicely, a rather quickly-done manicure looks like a much more professional job.  the long, specially shaped brush for the polish worked really well to apply it.

6287,"i've read the other reviewers' comments, and all are 'correct' however, here are a few things one needs to know before purchasing. if you thought this would look like the bottle all by itself, with a standard one or two coats, you'll be disappointed.  this polish is best used with other colors, or if alone, more than two coats.

yes the polish dries rough, and somewhat matte, to fix this use their top coat and the colors will also look much more intense.
also, i believe this polish was intended to be a topper, or an added dimension to an under coat of color, either holgraphic/opaque glimmer, or cream color.  if used on top of a pale pink, and topped with a gloss, the effect is girly to the max,,, also, depends on how many coats one uses.  top a red and you'll get more gold...  if used alone, over a standard base coat, try building up till the color intensity suits your look.  this could be three or four. while matte looks are a statement, the rougness makes using it that way less appealing.  this polish 'looks' like it would be glossy, but it's not, not by itself.  this can happen with almost any of the polishes that have actual glitter in them.

all in all this is a very versatile, flexible polish to have in your bag of nail tricks. the key is to get creative and have fun with it.",2012-09-16,5,5,A3DN1EHYLP0IIA,B01DQG3DFI

(this has happened before with generic, random skin creams) you just use a thin layer of this mask twice a week, so the bottle should last a long time making it a better value than it might appear at first glance.",2016-07-05,5,3,A2O421DTA8J0RW,B01GDUM666

6296,"this is a good collection of skin care products that will appeal to most people.  first of all they come a very nice metal container that can be used to store them and then reused to store many items.  i think that is attractive and helps to make the set even more appealing as a gift.  the design not only looks good, it is a raised print that has texture as well.  i think that before you buy any of the individual items, you should consider buying the whole set and trying each individual product to see which one works best for your skin type.

i love the vichy puret&eacute; thermale micellar cleansing water 3-in-1 one step cleanser.  i found that it is a very nice and mild cleanser that i like to use every day.  i have sensitive skin and it doesn't irritate my skin at all and it is good for makeup removal even though i have to use a cloth with it.  it has the consistency of water, so i use it with a microfiber cloth.

the vichy double glow peel face mask is probably my least favorite simply because it isn't a peel mask at all.  i don't know why they advertise it that way because that isn't how it works and that's not even how they tell you to use it.  the instructions tell you to apply, wait five minutes then gently massage to exfoliate, then rinse off.  no peeling at all.  they should change the name of the product.  also i noticed no glow at all.  i have dry skin and it did nothing.

the vichy hydrating quenching mineral face mask was okay.  i have dry skin and i didn't notice any major hydrating, but my skin didn't feel as dry and it did feel a bit softer.  since it says that the effect lasts for 24 hours, i plan to try this every day to see if i get a better result.

the vichy pore purifying clay face mask was okay.  it can only be used 1 to 2 times a week and i haven't noticed any negative effects.  it does say not to let it fully dry, but i find that hard since it is supposed to be left on for five minutes.

overall this is a nice gift set and i think that most people would probably like it.  i would like it a bit better if it included a moisturizer, but i didn't experience any problems with any of the products.",2017-10-12,4,3,A34TNH973Q9XT0,B01GDUM666

6298,"this review is for the complete gift set of 200 ml micellar solution, and three 15 ml jars of masks (pore purifying clay mask with two mineral clays; double glow peel mask with volcanic rock and aha; and quenching mineral mask with rare minerals and vitamin b3). it appears our review is being directed to just one of the masks. evaluating each part individually, the micellar solution is great for cleaning off makeup--especially eye makeup. many other micellar waters gave my wife a burning solution around the eyes. this one did not irritate, and had a light, refreshing scent. this is absolutely her favorite brand micellar solution so far. she's never been disappointed with the quality of vichy products.

each 15 ml jar has enough masks for 4-5 uses, and my wife personally has an oilier, mixed skin type. the clay mask was her favorite, and seems to control the oil secretions the best. the mineral mask has a refreshing effect and smells like fresh cucumber and maybe a cooling mint sensation? her least favorite was the peel mask, which smelled and felt nice, but seemed to have the least results, from before to after. it's the only one she would probably not buy again. overall, she is very satisfied with these vichy products, especially the micellar water and clay mask. the gift set comes in an attractive tin and would be great for a special lady. the scents might be strong for some who are sensitive, but my wife really liked them.",2017-09-04,5,4,APD7XINUVG5AL,B01GDUM666
6299,"the vichy multi-masking set includes a large 6.7 oz. puret thermale 3 in 1 micellar solution and three .5 oz sample sizes of the pore purifying clay mask (for purifying), quenching mineral mask (for hydration) and double glow peel mask (for dullness). i consider my skin dry and sensitive, and i'm really pleased with the micellar solution and clay mask while the other two masks don't seem well suited for my skin.

the micellar solution is wonderful, and i've grown to like it more over time. one of the first things i do when i get home after work is wet a cotton pad or cotton balls with the micellar solution and wipe my face. it's a quick and easy way to remove my makeup, cleanse and refresh my skin. the amount of makeup and grime left on the cotton pad is astonishing. this product feels gentle and contains no soap, colorants, oil or alcohol. it does list fragrance as an ingredient, but i really can't smell it. this is a great product.

i've tried all three masks. i'm impressed with how the clay mask makes my face feel. i apply a thin layer and rinse just before it's dry. my skin seems to soak the moisture right out of this mask for some reason, and it leaves my skin feeling smooth, fresh and extra clean. it also seems to soften white gunk in my clogged pores by my nose, though it doesn't remove it. but i then focus on those pores with my clarisonic and the mask seems to help get rid of the gunk. i'm very pleased with the clay mask.

the quenching mineral mask makes my skin itch, so i haven't continued to use it. denatured alcohol is a main ingredient, and i'm guessing but i don't think it agrees with my dry skin. it just doesn't feel good to me, even though it should given that it's for hydration. the double glow peel mask is an aha face scrub that should gently exfoliate. but it makes my sensitive skin feel like it's burning, and i need to rinse it off. denatured alcohol is the second ingredient, so i think the mask is likely too drying for my skin. overall, i do think this is a nice gift set even though only two of four products work well for me. 3.5 stars (rounded to 4 stars).",2017-09-02,4,4,A2L6BT1PVV9YN0,B01GDUM666
6300,"i feel like these products are missing something...

the clay mask: love the way it feels on my face... it feels tight and doesn't cake or dry out my face. it smooths on very well.  i don't see why i only have to leave it on for 3-5 minutes... i followed directions because i didn't want a red face... anyway, after 3-5 mins i washed it off-it came off as easily as it went on. i didn't feel any different when i washed it off. like i said, i like the tightening effect while it's on. 3-5 doesn't seem long enough.

the makeup cleanser works like a charm. doesn't take a lot and the smell is faint.

the gloss kinda burns... it didn't cause damage to my husband's face but it stung. the smell is pleasant and the substance is gel like. also, leave on for 3-5 mins.

i'll be trying the last mask tomorrow and will update.

if you're thinking this is the mask that peels off, like the viral videos, you're wrong. this wipes off by using a towel and warm water.",2017-08-31,4,4,A16NRV54CGOO69,B01GDUM666
6301,"this is another fun set by vichy. first of all, as i've said in other reviews, the micellar water is the best cleanser i've ever used on my skin. there are lots of brands and they all seem to work well for me. my complexion is the clearest it's been in years. the kit includes a large size bottle of the micellar water. there are three different masks as well and they are sample size.
double glow peel mask: this is my favorite of the three masks. it has barely any scent and is light to apply. it certainly does make my skin glow as described.
quenching mineral mask: this is another light mask that really gives moisture to your skin. after you use it, you're supposed to rub it in the skin. this always seems weird to me, but i know they just want the product to continue to moisturize your skin. i'm a little hesitant to leave it all on my skin, but it's a nice mask.
pore purifying clay mask: i liked this one the least, but it's not bad overall. it has a strong scent, which bothers me. the clay does help with impurities and it's easy to apply. i just prefer the other two over this one.
all and all a very nice set in a pretty colored tin box. this would be a great gift too. recommended.",2017-08-30,4,3,A3091RP0SPZLMN,B01GDUM666
6302,"this set includes three different "masks" which offer different benefits for different users.  the clay mask does an amazing job removing impurities and shrinking the size of your pores while the quenching mineral mask re-hydrates your skin to an almost profound degree.  one of my favorite products is the generously sized bottle of vichy micellar cleansing water and makeup remover.  i use this cleanser on an almost daily basis for everything except my waterproof eye makeup.  it does a great job of cleaning deep down inside your pores and i've never felt the least bit of irritation using it.  this set is a great place to start if you aren't sure which of these masks is the best fit for your needs.

i love vichy products.  i have had the opportunity to try a number of them and have always found them to be very high quality and effective.  i have sensitive skin and have never had the first bit of an issue with them causing redness or irritation.",2017-08-27,5,5,A3IUW081KXD3PE,B01GDUM666
6303,"this review is on the multi-masking set which contains four products: purete thermale 3 in 1 cleansing solution, pore purifying clay mask, quenching mineral mask, and the double glow peel mask. below is my review for each of these products.

1. purete thermale (cleansing solution): 5 stars. i absolutely love this product. it feels and smells so good--and it cleans wonderfully!

2. clay mask: 5 stars! this is the first time i have used a clay mask on my face and i couldn't believe how smooth my face felt afterwards and for the next several days. i'm going to use this twice a week forever! the directions state to apply a thin layer and let it dry for 3-5 minutes and then wash it off. i always thought clay masks were left on until they dry so i checked online for information regarding this. i found out that you shouldn't let the mask dry because that will dry out your face.

3. quenching mineral mask: 3-4 stars. i love the smell and texture of this. you put it on your face and let it sit for 5 minutes, then massage the excess in. i used this before bedtime. it felt good at the time. the next morning when i washed my face the water reactivated the mask and i just didn't like the feel of it. i felt the mask hadn't soaked into my skin and was still on the surface. perhaps i applied it too thickly the night before.

4. double glow peel mask: 1 star. totally disappointment because i was expecting something that actually peeled off my face. the directions are to "apply and let sit for 5 minutes, then massage gently with finger tips. rinse off with water." after 5 minutes everything was still so wet and goopy that  massaging it didn't seem to do anything. i waited another 5 minutes hoping it would dry a bit more and work more like a traditional peel mask. it didn't. i did not notice much difference after using it.",2017-08-27,4,2,AMBFK6N4JS5Z2,B01GDUM666
6304,"this is a nice set, although the masks included are very tiny jars and are probably only good for a few uses. the cleanser works fine, but didn't really leave my skin feeling refreshed or any softer or tighter. the masks themselves, well, seemed made mainly of snake oil. i noticed no difference in the product, unlike the agora stuff i normally use. you'd probably have the same effects with drugstore stuff, like oil of olay.",2017-08-27,2,3,A2XAQOWHRPY98K,B01GDUM666
6305,"i love this set! the micellar cleansing water/toner/makeup remover is great for use after work, to remove makeup, and the three masks are in small jars, good for travel kits. there is one aha peel mask, one clay mask, and one "quenching mineral mask." the clay and peel masks you remove after 5 minutes, rinsing off with water. the mineral mask you let sit for 5 minutes, and then "massage the excess in." you will love this set to use for your nightly routine, or to treat yourself to an at-home "spa day."",2017-08-26,5,5,A2LE2MFI4QTQY4,B01GDUM666
6306,"the vichy multi-masking gift set comes in a cute tin for a nice presentation. there's a full size (6.7 oz) bottle of micellar water and 3 small 1/2 ounce jars of different mask products. the micellar water cleans my face very well. i use it with a cotton ball. it says that it can be used to remove eye make up, but it stung my eyes a bit. i have super sensitive eyes, so that didn't surprise me. some shampoos will cause my eyes to sting without even getting in my eyes! i enjoyed trying out the different masks. only one, the pore purifying clay mask, was a traditional mask that i am accustomed to using. the double glow peel mask is more of a scrub and the quenching mineral mask is a thick moisturizing gel type product. all of the masks are 5 minutes or less. each one says to use it once or twice a week. they all left my skin feeling soft and clean.",2017-08-26,4,5,AWXQORMZ3JY4P,B01GDUM666
6307,"i had previously tried a moisturizer from vichy and been very pleased and being a big fan of facial masks i wanted to give these a go.  they are packed in a cute tin with the three masks and the makeup and eye makeup remover.  out of the three masks, i think my favorite was the clay mask, followed by the peel and then the moisturizing mask.  all the masks only require 5 minutes to set, so no major time is involved.  none of the three masks had any real scent that i could make out.  the clay was smooth, dried up and made my skin feel great.  the peel was the most surprising as it has some grit to it.  not a lot, just a light grainy feel.  that mask had a tiny bit of a sting to it upon application that quickly diminished.  after 5 minutes you massage into your face some more and then rinse off.  the moisturizing mask also sits on the face for 5 minutes but the instructions only advise to massage into the face, not rinse off.  i felt doing this made my face feel slightly sticky, so maybe i didn't need the extra hydration.  i just put my moisturizer over the top of it and it felt good on my face.  i love the makeup remover.  i used it over my face as well as to remove mascara and it didn't not have any scent and took off the makeup with no issue.  overall, two of the three masks i would likely buy, as well as the makeup remover. the hydration mask will be used but i would likely not purchase on it's own.  just for reference, i have normal skin, edging a bit on the oily over dry and wore mascara, blush and tinted moisturizer when i tested the make-up remover.",2017-08-25,4,3,A1KEK09ZA6J9P8,B01GDUM666

6309,"i have used vichy's micellar water before and really like it. it's great for removing makeup, though i will note that i also cleanse with water and cleanser when i use it or i just don't feel clean.

the masks are in teeny tiny little pots. like, you might get 4 or 5 full face masks out of each. these are not like the other big brand multi masking kit you've seen ads for - there is only one clay mask and the others are gels.

i used the clay mask on the oily and clogged parts of my face. it worked like other clay masks i have tried, but did seem more gentle. it did decrease the size and severity of the zits i had. i was pleased with it and it has a pleasant smell.

the pink mask, i used on areas that needed to be a little brighter - this is good for dull skin. i wasn't expecting to notice anything when i took it off, but my cheeks really did look less dull. this mask has pumice in it and it advises you to rub it in after masking. i did this very gently. i did not want to tear my skin.

the blue mask is for areas that need more moisture. i used this on my forehead and under my eyes. i did not really notice much difference with this one - i feel better using my typical moisture routine (a rich cream covered with aquaphor)",2017-08-24,4,4,A35OQ90FU3P52,B01GDUM666
6310,"well, all is wonderful with this lovely set of three vichy masks and a cleansing water.  i was happy to be able to sample these in order to choose the one that i feel works the best for my skin.  i first tried each one on the inside of my arm to make sure there were no allergic reactions.  perfect!  each day i tried one of the masks, and used the micellar water either before the masks, or during the day or evening.  i was not familiar with this company before, except for their lip balm which is very nice.  apparently, this french company has been in business over 80 years, and very well received.  all the masks have individual natural scents that are light and subtle, nothing overpowering.  first up was the double glow peel (pink), my 2nd favorite.  it goes on sticky, then you gently rub it around to get the benefit of the volcanic rock and fruit acid. after about 5 minutes, rinse it off.  it is basically a chemical peel that does a good job of exfoliating, then leaving a nice cool, smooth, and refreshed face.  next up was the purifying clay mask (white), my least favorite only because i happen to have very fine pores and no oily areas. it spread around easily, had a nice texture, and did not feel tight, and i think it has good purifying qualities. i must say that my face felt smooth and soft after rinsing, again after 5 minutes.  the last one, my favorite, the hydrating mask (aqua) is super!  it is a cool gel that is a moisturizer and no oil. it leaves my face feeling refreshed, soothed, and hydrated (obviously i have dry skin).  with this mask it can be left on or wiped off, and for the summer, it feels great!  as for the micellar water cleanser, use a cotton ball and it works well for removing makeup, is a refreshing pick-me-up, and does not require rinsing.",2017-08-23,5,5,A3IR834T7AROBT,B01GDUM666
6311,"this review, for the vichy multi-masking set, covers all the individual masks since the set includes little pots of each, plus vichy micellar water.  each piece comes wrapped in tissue paper inside an attractive tin.  but if you're looking to purchase one of the individual masks, skip to the mini-review below of the one you are considering.  each component is high-quality and non-irritating -- at least for this sensitive skin woman.

clay mask:  this mask is perhaps the closest to what americans consider a facial mask.  the product is putty-gray and creamy, making it both easy to apply and visible so that you won't accidentally avoid any areas.  you let it dry for 3-5 minutes, then rinse off.  i felt it tightening my skin within a minute or so.  this is surprisingly easy to rinse off, something that doesn't always happen with clay masks, perhaps because it's not as thick as those others.  it makes my skin feel tight, smooth, and clean without drying.  you know those annoying clogged pores in your nose?  gone.  5 stars

double glow peel mask:  this mask is likely to be the most perplexing of the lot because it contains the words "peel" and "mask" next to each other, which generally means, in american parlance, that you will coat your face and literally peel off the product.  not so.  it contains mild acids to peel in the first step of the process and fine volcanic rock to exfoliate in step two.  you apply to your face, let dry for five minutes (peel) and rub the dried product in a circular motion (exfoliate), then rinse off.  like the clay mask, i felt my skin tightening as the mask dried.  the exfoliating volcanic rock feels scarce, though, and i'm not sure the few grains are enough to truly exfoliate.  plus, unlike most vichy products, this one contains dimethicone (silicone.)  that said, my face feels and looks fresh afterward, so it must do something good to my skin.  4 stars

quenching mineral mask:  this mask is designed to deliver extra moisture to your skin.  it is a no-rinse product that begins as a mask, then gets rubbed into your face after five minutes of sitting on the surface.  i like it as a summer moisturizer since it doesn't leave any oils behind.  i'm not sure it will be strong enough when my skin dries more in the winter.  regardless, my skin feels supple and fresh afterward.

vichy micellar water:  i can't say enough about this fine product.  it's a no-rinse cleanser that feels like a gentle astringent.  it cleans without drying or irritation.  i use this every day, and i use it before moisturizing, after athletic activity, and for a quick mid-day refreshing.  it removes makeup and dirt, often with a single pass.  although the masks did not instruct me to clean my face before applying them, i use this micellar water or my usual face wash before applying them.

vichy makes great facial care products, and these masks are no exception.  as long as you understand what they are, you won't be disappointed.

6312,"the small sample sizes of all the different masks and the 3 in 1 "lotion" made it difficult for me to choose which product to try first as vichy is one of my favorite beauty lines.  because the manufacturer has so very many products which basically do the same thing, cleanse and hydrate, you won't go wrong with any that you use.",2017-08-19,5,5,A1V1EP514B5H7Y,B01GDUM666

6315,"it is perfect. it softens the skin and lightens it slightly, i imagine by taking off all the dead cells. it has a calming effect on my 40+ age skin, it moisturizes and deep cleans it without stripping off the oils. it is easy to put on and easy to remove with a simple washcloth. the jar lasts for some time. it does not take more than a teaspoon to cover the entire face. i do it every week or two in a warm weather and once a month in winter.",2017-02-17,5,5,AS7SB0A3QKVQV,B01GDUM666

6317,"this is a great facial mask. i use it two or three times a week, and it leaves my skin feeling very fresh and hydrated. i think it will be really great at combating the dryness of winter air on my skin. i really like that you don't need to rinse it off. (i've found that masks that need to be rinsed often end up drying my skin.) the instructions say to wipe it off with a cotton pad, but i've found this step isn't necessary. it basically absorbs into the skin and leaves no residue.",2016-11-26,5,5,A2K4MXD1N2LFJB,B01GDUM666
6318,"first of all, this is not a "peel off" mask if that is what you are looking for.  this is a much more simple and convenient mask.  you apply the product, let dry for five minutes, then wipe off with cotton pads.  i have read some other reviewers state that they "put it on before bed."  i do not think it is intended to be left on your skin for an extended period.  when applied, it is a bit "tacky;" but it washes off without much effort and leaves my skin feeling very refreshed and "tingly."  personally, i have come to prefer applying the product in the early evening to "wash off" the many impurities we encounter during the day.  it seems to give me a little "second wind" as i start my evening routine.  i do have combination skin.  the product definitely helps moisturize my dry areas without making my oily areas feel more greasy.  with that said, i have started to focus on using the product more on the dry areas and less on the normal to oily areas.  this will make the product last a little longer.",2016-11-21,4,3,AFYQ9V4XBVCJ1,B01GDUM666
6319,"this is an interesting facial mask, different from any i've used before.  it's more of a gel that you use on your cleaned face.  after cleaning your face, apply a thin layer of vichy quenching mineral face mask, let it dry about 5 minutes, then wipe it away with a clean cloth or cotton pad.  after it dries, your skin might feel slightly tacky. if that bothers you, then you'll probably want to rinse the mask off.  however, leaving the mask on your face will provide about 24 hours of moisturization.  this gel mask provides vitamin b3  which helps soothe your skin.

6320,"another awesome product from vichy. my skin is quite different on my cheeks (smooth and balanced) vs my t-zone (bumpy and oily) bit this mask seems to give each area exactly what it needs. after taking it off, my skin feels refreshed and rehydrated in all areas without adding any extra oil. it does have a light floral smell, but it's not overwhelming. the only thing i didn't quite like was the consistency. it felt a little sticky and uneven, but my skin still really liked it so i'm happy.",2016-11-16,4,5,A26FEJTPYJ934F,B01GDUM666
6321,"nothing particularly bad about this mask.  it goes on nicely and doesn't feel bad on.  as for being a mineral mask, i don't see that. on the maker's website, the ingredients are:

if it feels good, use it and it does feel good on your face.  but as for being some special mineral treatment, not at all.  that makes the cost prohibitive to me.

granted, there are no directions on the box or the jar, but if you look at the product description or google the product, it tells you:

"gently apply to skin, leave on for 5 minutes. wipe away face mask with a cotton pad. no rinsing required."

i followed the instructions. i like the light scent, but i could do without the cooling sensation.

i'm sensitive to a lot of skincare products and usually use olay products, but i liked the hydration from this vichy "mask"...just in time for winter.

6330,"this review is for the vichy quenching mineral facial mask for dry skin:

when i purchased this, it's labeled as a mask, so i thought it was the type that you leave on for 10-15 min & then take off.  so as i was reading the instructions, i was kind of confused as to what it does?

the bottle contains 2.54 oz & the gel is a translucent pale blue. its a pretty bottle, but the lettering on the back of the bottle is almost impossible to read. the box says to use: apply & let sit for 5 minutes, then massage the excess in. use 1-3 times a week as needed. avoid eye & lip areas. rinse them in case of contact. (it never specifies how long to leave this on or what amount of time works best? is it apply at night & leave overnight?).

the gel goes on gooey & sticky. it makes your skin appear shiny when its applied. it has a light scent of jasmine water & bamboo that lingers until you wash it off. the scent is nice, very subtle, & non-flowery. at first use, i tested it on my forehead & a small patch on my hand to make sure there wasn't a reaction. it did not seem to dry all that fast, so i think if you were placing all over your face, then laying down to sleep, it make a slight mess on your pillowcase. in regards to softening dry skin, it seemed to just be more sticky than actually helping the dryness. i only used it a few times because i did not like how sticky it was. i used it at night before bed. never tried it in the morning before applying makeup.

likes:
pleasant smell
no parabens

dislikes:
sticky

overall, i gave it 3 stars. while it didn't work for me, someone who like gel type products may enjoy. i did like that it was a pleasant scent & not overpowering.",2016-11-01,3,3,AK3402G7FO7AY,B01GDUM666
6331,"vichy quenching mineral mask

the cold and windy weather make my skin very dry, stiff and even flakes no matter how many times a day i apply moisturizer.

i applied the mask after the toner since you are not supposed to rinse this off. it could have been that i had just exfoliated my face but there was a very slight tingling sensation (less than ten seconds). it took longer than five minutes to absorb, i would say more on the 15 minute mark. i did not immediately feel any difference but i did notice my face was very sticky, the kind of sticky you get from a wet piece of candy. i touched my face and my fingers were sticky from touching!

it was not until about half an hour later that i finally felt any sort of effect on my face.

while the scent is not bad at first, it might feel irritating to your nose after some time, depending on your nose sensitivity.

i might have to stick to once a week application as i was not a fan of the stickiness. the following day my skin was as dry as the day before, but i know i cannot expect a one time use to do miracles overnight.

maybe i did something wrong and if you are a beauty expert, i am more than open to suggestions on how to avoid that.

in the meantime, i am giving it 3 stars until i find a solution to the sticky issue.",2016-10-27,3,3,A93GW5XX51MAP,B01GDUM666

this pleasantly fragranced, cool, refreshing facial mask is great for the dry areas of my face. i only apply it on my cheeks and neck. it provides hydration and is moisturizing for an extended amount of time. it softens my skin and feels great. i prefer using this in the evening and makes for a wonderful morning face. a simple warm washcloth in the morning has me ready for primer and makeup.",2016-10-26,5,5,A2MUGFV2TDQ47K,B01GDUM666
6334,"this is very nice for a facial mask.i have combination skin (a slightly oily forehead and the rest is dry skin). applied to my cheeks and chin, this works well. i left it on for 5 minutes and removed it with absorbent cotton pads. it left my skin feeling tingly and fresh while it tended to remove the impurities on my skin. my face appeared brighter and smoother and looked pretty nice for sort of old (no wrinkles here) skin that has seen too much sun and has been exposed to the elements.
the end result was there was increased hydration in the dry, patchy areas. very nice! if you have had trouble achieving a good balance on patchy skin, i'd suggest you give this product a try for hydration and increased elasticity.",2016-10-26,4,3,A2ZY49IDE6TY5I,B01GDUM666
6335,"i love the smell of this.  i was concerned that the bottle had broken when i opened the bag it was packed in because the smell was so rich.  no breaks though, just the lovely scent.  i can not for the life of me figure out what the scent is, not even from the ingredients.  it is what aqua should smell like, maybe a little citrusy, slightly flowery.  the box says parfum.  that's helpful.  but anyway, i mention the scent because so many people are sensitive to things that are scented.  sometimes i am.  this one did not offend.

honestly, once it was on, before i wiped it off, it didn't feel like anything was on my face.  it is not like a masque that tightens your skin or dries.

6336,"ok, first of all..have used less than a month so longer range results i couldn't tell you.  you put this on then rub any excess in.  this is not the "mask" that you apply then wash off.  it does cool your face, i'm thinking alittle menthol somewhere in the ingredients?  after 1 month skin should feel more supple, refreshed, renewed.  it makes my skin feel soft and smooth, hasn't broken out and seems to help calm the face flushes i get.  says it has b3 added to it(?)  allergy/sensitive skin tested, no parabens.  i can find no symbols showing no animal testing.  ingredients beside the famous vichy volcanic thermal water and glycerin: denatured alcohol, many glycols, castor oil, carbomer..perfume too.  i'm assuming that is the green tea, jasmin water, and bamboo light fragrance you can smell. only to be used 1-3 times a week.  i'm going to keep using this is a good size jar for the money",2016-10-25,4,5,A13GZCHAMKWYBT,B01GDUM666
6337,"i have transitioned almost exclusively to vichy skin-care products over the last year. i have been very satisfied with all of them and was looking forward to trying a new mask. i have been alternating between the peachy gel mask and the clay mask for the oily t zone.  what a clever idea to use all three at once for combination skin! however, because of their different consistency, the only way ive found that this works well is to apply all three on the required zones, leave for about five minutes, then wash off with a washcloth.

 the mineral mask is a clear gel with a faint jasmine scent. the ingredients are:

aqua glycer i n  alcohol denat. niacinamide  dipropylene glycol pentylene glycol  butylene glycol peg-8  peg/ppg/polybutyleneglycol-8/5/3 glycerin  peg-60hydrogenated castor oil  ci 61570  carbomer  triethanolamine phenoxyethanol  ammoniumpolyacryloyldimethyltaurate  tetrasodium edta menthoxyprop diolt-butylalcoho l parfumcode f.i.l. : c182661/1

the quenching mineral mask has sort of conflicting instructions.  they say apply for five minutes then massage the excess in or remove with a cotton ball. this just doesnt work for me. i don't know how to describe the consistency, after five minutes, except to say it is sort of like rubber cement. youre not massaging it anywhere. ive found what works best for me is to clean my face with a transparent soap and apply a thin coat of the mask. i just leave it on overnight and in the morning my face is very soft and smooth with fewer fine wrinkles. it takes about two hours for it to absorb into my skin and stop being sticky.

use one to three times a week, as needed. my jar has a use-by date of 04/19.",2016-10-25,5,3,A2G04D4QZAXL15,B01GDUM666

as i get older, my skin turns dry beginning around this time every year and stays dry until may.  so i'm looking for a good mask.  application is easy.  a little bit goes a long way.  it's a cooling gel.  it's thinner than vaseline but thicker than water.  at first, i thought that this would be my first disappointment in the vichy line.  i'm used to slathering on thick creams to get the results i needed.  i shouldn't have worried.  although it seems a bit thin, this gel was moisturizing.  i used it at night and my dry patches around my crows feet were noticeably less creased.  this lasted for two days so it's not a permanent solution.  hopefully, with continued use it might be longer lasting.",2016-10-24,5,4,A3CW8OUDH7M079,B01GDUM666

no problem, i thought.  surely there are instructions on the jar.  if there are, you can't see them.  the print on the jar is a pale gray, against the peachy pink of the product, and very small.  even with my reading glasses and good light, i could not make it out.

again, no problem, i thought.  i know how to use a peel mask.

i washed my face, toned it, and applied.  after a while (keep in mind i'm flying on no instructions here), i massaged it in feeling its very mild abrasive action.  then i washed it off in the shower.  (it doesn't come off easily, due to the itty bitty nature of the grains.  showering seems to work best.)

my skin felt clean and refreshed.  i had no allergic reactions to it at all, which probably sets a high standard in sensitivity because i react to almost anything.  it does contain some fragrance, but it didn't bother y ridiculously sensitive skin.

did my skin look 10 years younger?  um... no.  did it look better?  can't tell.  i use a variety of high-end skin products so, for my age, my skin looks good.  it continued to look good with the vichy double glow facial peel mask.

i've used it for a couple of weeks now, and my skin continues to look good.  it's very gentle, and not too expensive.

it's paraben-free. it's made with vichy water, which, legend tells us, is full of all sorts of magical powers.  it has ahas, which dermatologists tell us, are full of scientifically magical powers.

6350,"vichy pore purifying clay mask is a light clay mask for combination and oily skin that features bentonite and kaolin clays. it claims to purify skin, soothe skin, eliminate dirt and pollutants, mattify skin, leave skin feeling soft and clean, and reduce pore size with regular use. vichy also claims that it is safe for sensitive skin. aloe vera and allantoin are the soothing ingredients. i have very sensitive skin with effectively no barrier. ive had bad reactions to clay masks in the past and have found them too drying, but i gave this one a try, because the ingredients seemed mild, and the instructions said to leave the mask on for only 3-5 minutes. it should not dry on your skin. the clay is fine-textured and gray. it goes on in a thin layer, so a 2.54 oz (75 ml) jar will last a long time. vichy recommends to use it 1-2 times per week, concentrating on the t-zone area or wherever your pores tend to clog. rinse off with water.

i started with a small area to make sure i wasn't going to react to the mask. i ended up using it on my whole face. i left the mask on for about 6 minutes, and it was dry in spots. it dries quite quickly. i can confirm vichys claim that this mask works with sensitive skin. i didn't have any problems with it. i was a little concerned that my skin would react to the fragrance, which i have seen described as a light scent of mint and woody amber. i don't smell the mint, but i would describe the scent as an amber with woody notes. its musky, and i think there are some florals in there. it does not seem light when the mask is smeared on my face, in close proximity to my nose. i found the scent unpleasant after a while. its too strong for a mask, and the musky-floral mlange is an odd choice.

i was most interested in the masks pore-clarifying properties. it removed about half of blackheads and performed less well on smaller oil deposits that were not oxidized. i assessed the results in a 10x magnifying mirror, which is scary but essential to see how skin care products are working and to distinguish between a blackhead and a freckle. my coui nourishing cleansing oil does a better job on the oil deposits. a fine-grained scrub removes both blackheads and other oil deposits. the vichy pore purifying clay mask did leave my skin feeling smoother than it began, but not as smooth or soft as im accustomed to when i do a facial treatment. ive used other mud masks that worked better on blackheads and oil but proved too harsh for my skin. so there is a trade-off. if you have sensitive skin and like masks, this one is probably safe. there are more effective alternatives, however.

6351,"i have oily skin. i tried the mask and aside from a perfume like smell which lessened over time i enjoyed the experience.  my face feels cleaner. this did not irritate my skin in anyway and the mask was easy to remove.  in addition a little goes a long way.

my only concern is that when i open the bottle i do notice sweet perfume like smell.  i don't react well to strong fragrances and just smelling perfume and cologne can cause a reaction in me. yet, once i put the mask on the smell lessened and my face felt fine afterward and i did not get a reaction.

my face does feel cleaner and less oily after i use this. it has been very warm where i am so i sweat a lot. after using this mask my face feels cooler and cleaner.  a little of the mask will go a long way since this can be put on in a very thin layer.  i am pleased with this product.",2016-07-17,4,5,A2068BC3ZXAVJQ,B01GDUM666

at the moment, i'm in an area with high humidity. that means that my usual heavier creams and skin care products just don't have the right feel. this is the mask you want when temps soar.

it seems that with each passing year, the pores on my nose become larger. or maybe it's because i invest more in magnifying mirrors as my eyes appreciate any help they can get. haven't noticed a diminished size, but super clean pores look smaller, so in my opinion, this product does deliver.

 anyway, i do love this mask after a long day when my skin feels hot and sticky.
you feel super clean afterwards without feeling as if your skin has been stripped of all of its natural moisture.",2016-07-14,5,5,A2YKWYC3WQJX5J,B01GDUM666
6354,"unlike all the other reviewers so far, i did not like this clay mask at all.  first, the box seal was broken.  not a good thing for a cosmetic product, especially a facial one.  second, the "woodsy" scent is pretty intolerable to me and it lingers.  it did not cause a sinus headache, but i simply can't stand it.  third, even though i have combination skin, the mask left my skin feeling tight and dry.  i might have expected that in the winter, when electric heat dries out my skin, but not in the summer.  (the product is recommended for combination to oily skin.)  on a positive note, however, it is a good clarifying mask; it does leave your skin bright and clean.  i like using&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/noxzema-classic-clean-moisturizing-cream-12oz/dp/b003la90ru/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8">noxzema classic clean moisturizing cream 12oz</a>, especially in the summer since it lowers skin temperature, but it leaves a film, and i use a clarifying soap so often due to that.  this clay mask would work well as a clarifier, but i dislike too much about it to use it again.",2016-07-14,2,3,A3FS3FJPD3RJTD,B01GDUM666

6356,"when i ordered this i thought it might be similar to the tony moly floria brigtening peel gel - a korean fruit acid gel that purports to instantly slough off the top layer of dead skin to reveal a brighter complexion.  you can feel the somewhat coarse texture of the tony moly scrub working and it definitely leaves the skin with a vague tingling/burning sensation.  and, while my skin is hardly sensitive, it did not react well and i gave it up after two uses.

happily, this is much milder and feels very refreshing.

the box states the lightly crisp fragrance is a mixture of apple, cassis and musk (!).  while it sits on the face it feels damp and cool (perfect, since i was using it during our first heatwave of the season).  despite my leaving it on for triple the recommended five minutes, this does not dry at all, so determining whether it's done the job is a bit of an exercise in trust.  when ready to rinse, i just moistened it with a bit of warm water and massaged it into my skin, then gave it a good rinse. and, for some reason, this is pretty stubborn, so it really does require a looooong hot rinse.  the grains are very, very fine so i didn't get the sense that this doing much as a mechanical exfoliant and i think the acid content is very mild, because i experienced none of the usual tingling/itching  you normally get in the aftermath of a glycolic acid treatment.  but all that said, my skin did feel very fresh, super-clean and kind of dewy immediately after the treatment.

after using this every other night for a week, i can say this is a nice mild peel which would be perfect for someone with sensitive skin.",2016-07-14,4,4,A1Y7C52533BA2H,B01GDUM666
6357,"i have tried 5 or 6 vichy products and some are great hits and some are not. i am a big fan of the neovadiol line and buy the oil to use regularly. we also use bliss peel pads a lot and love the results. as far as a peel, this works really nicely. it takes off the dead skin and removes impurities, and tightens and cleans pores.

you leave this product on for 5 minutes and wash it off. the tiny particles of volcanic rock scrub up my skin and after use my skin feels nice and soft and it tightens my skin.

for the cost, this is a good product. the peel pads are really expensive, albeit you get a lot of them in a box. it doesn't take a lot of this product to cover your face so the bottle should last a while if you use it twice a week. so, for the price, i would say this facial peel mask is a pretty good deal as long as you don't use too much. it does help to shrink pores and it super cleans your face. i am not sure yet if i would switch and only use this product instead of the peel pads, but i do like it a lot.",2016-07-13,5,4,A6QG9LM5WL0AQ,B01GDUM666
6358,"i've been giving everyone in the family a mini-spa treatment and it's been great fun.  the guys initially balked but then they relaxed and ended up enjoying the pampering and results.

since the family complexions from from china-doll fine pores to acne prone teen skin to grizzly old dad skin this vichy clay mask got a good workout.  to sum it up briefly, this is a great product.  it's easy to use and gentle.  only me with my super dry skin would have to be careful of how often i used it.

the jar you get is filled with a grey clay mixture.  when i applied it i found that i really didn't need to use that much.  the mask particles are extremely fine and glide on.  there's no feeling of piling mud on your face, and absolutely no grittiness.

the fine layer that we were applying felt good and after it was washed off everyone commented --even teenboy-- how refreshing it felt.  both teens had pimples at the time and the irritation and the bumps were reduced afterwards.

if you've never tried a mask before, i suggest you start with this one.  it's superior to every other mask i've used.",2016-07-13,5,5,AQ6AGWKWMTY8H,B01GDUM666

i followed up with vichy aqualia thermal cream which is very emollient. my skin felt clean, fresh and soft.
also, the expiration date on the clay mask is 2019, so, even if you only used it occasionally it would be good for years.",2016-07-12,5,4,A7EK88GF8N40F,B01GDUM666

6361,"this gel feels good going on, and my face does seem brighter and fresher after using.  however, i grew up in the days when baby oil and suntan lotion were used instead of sunscreen, so i'm not expecting miracles.

so why only a three-star rating?  the product has absolutely no safety sealing.  the lid of the jar screws off with no protective band, and there is no safety seal underneath.  if i had bought this in a store, i'd be afraid to use it.  i was still a little apprehensive, but i did try it because it comes straight from the warehouse,  but why no protection?

the instructions are hard to find and hard to read.  i assume that you use it on a freshly cleansed face and follow up with regular moisturizer.  there is a label on the back of the jar, but it is on a transparent sticker and printed in light gray so i cannot read it at all.

you are supposed to leave this on your face for five minutes, then gently massage, then rinse off.  when i tried to massage, it felt too dry, so i used wet fingertips, and that worked well.  when i massage, i can feel the grittiness, the volcanic rock part, working.  and i did like the results.

i do have sensitive skin and this did not bother it or sting (unlike bliss a-peel that killed me).  masks are all the rage now.

i have really good skin in most areas but i do have some hyperpigmentation on my cheekbones. i intend in the future to make this last by only using it on my cheekbones.",2016-07-12,5,5,A2LAS014NSRW72,B01GDUM666

the oil arrives packaged in a high-end, nicely colored, aesthetically pleasing bottle, which comes with a convenient dropper.

the smell is very light and airy and i always take a second sniff, or more, since one sniff is not enough. most important, of course, are results. i apply creams on my facial and neck area and dab (a little goes a long way!) a few drops of oil around my eyes. i must say, the oil is better than my vitamin c serum that i used before obtaining elemis. i can see the difference in my crows feet, wrinkles and fine lines around my eyes and the area nicely moisturized without any indication of dryness.

best of all, it doesnt even feel oily, instead it feels smooth and pure. everything about elemis is cruise-like and spa-like quality through and through.

6387,"this is one of the best skincare products i've ever tried. in late 2013 i went for a facial. it was a first-ever manual face treatment that impressed me by an immediate effect. i went back a couple of times and at the beginning of 2014 bought all the products that esthetician used on my face.
four years later this is only the product i swear by. i'm 38 years old and i don't have any smile lines around my eyes. people tell me that it's impossible that i'm that old. my eyes don't have wrinkles!
since the age of five, i always had under eye bags and circles. i've tried many skin care products, but nothing was making the difference, except this serum (and chanel beauty initiale - discontinued).

6390,"the first couple ingredients are jojoba seed oil and poppy seed oil. i've heard of jojoba seed oil and i normally get mine from mountain rose herbs in oregon (via mail order). i've never heard of poppy seed oil. there's a few other oils and also some very nice essential oils like lavender, geranium, camomile, peppermint, orange, and clove (among a few others). there is also kelp and some other extracts i've never heard of.

what's weird to me is it's like a dry oil - or a non-greasy oil. to me, it doesn't feel like it really moisturizes, but i'm sure it does, it just feels different than anything else i've tried.

don't be fooled by the bottle - the color of the oil is more of a clear beige-ish color, not blue and yellow - that's the bottle color. i love the bottle and will definetly reuse it.

okay, what i don't like about it - the added perfume scent. i don't understand why they added that with all those nice essential oils that make for a natural scent. instead, i smell the perfume scent. although not overpowering, i still don't like it. so to cover it up, i added a few of my own young living brand essential oils - now it's perfect!

price. i think this is overpriced for what you get, but i have to admit it's unique. if you're a do-it-yourself person, you could get a lot of the ingredients and make something similar yourself. i don't think a lot of people have time for all that with our hectic lifestyles, so in that case, if you can afford it, try it!

6398,"update: after using this a couple of more times, i didn't have any irritation, so that first time must have been something else. so, for that reason, since i love the way it feels, im adding a star from 3 to 4. this face wash feels amazing.
-

vichy purete thermale 3-in-1 face wash is a  purifying milk facial wash, eye makeup remover, and toner. i don't really get the toner part, but i can clearly see the milk facial wash part.

i received a 3.3oz sized tube, which is sort of a travel size compared to the full 6.7 sized product. the value of the trial/travel size is about $9.50, while the regular size is  just under $20.

i love vichy products, and find their items are reasonably priced so i can afford them in my tight budget.

though this is for sensitive skin, i am getting a little bit of an itch to my skin from it. something in it irritates my skin just a little. i do have sensitive skin. this does happen with products from time to time. its not bad, but it is there so i have to put this in my review, and is the reason for 3 stars instead of 4, since it is supposed to be made for sensitive skin. its the only negative to this product. ive not had any problems with any other vichy facial product, and as happens with some products, there will be that slight irritation and then it goes away.

the creamy consistency makes it really easy to smooth onto my face. you can wash it away with water or just swipe it awayi chose to wash it away. as some reviewers mentioned, it does feel as if it isn't quite washing all away, but i don't mind this, and in fact, i like the moisturizing feel of it. and afterwards, my skin feels so very very softi love that!  i put some on my hands and instead of washing it away, i just wiped my hands on a towel, and my hands were super softno residue is felt as i type this, just soft hands.

what i like about it, as well, is its thicker than the usually micellar waters ive tried; more of a creamy consistency instead of a water consistency.

the vichy product line has been around for about 80 years. they have a really nice website with an online magazine with information you can peruse on skin care and their products. theres plenty of information there to learn about vichy and its product line.

vichy and loreal are two of my regular go-to companies for skin care. ive been pleased with the quality, results, and the reasonable price. the only negative to this 3-in-1 is that slight irritation to my skinvery slight but still there all the same. however, it feels so luxe on my skin, ill likely use it unless i have more irritation from it with continued use.",2018-04-19,4,3,A1A25TP5D0L22V,B000V3ME6Y

i like this body lotion. just a small amount at a time is all i need to rob over my body after shower. so far its working well and i no longer feel itchy. it is lightly scented and dries quickly upon application. ingredients include what germ oil and honey extract. who knew good food can be applied effectively on skin?",2016-10-04,4,5,A3G2MJPURQSCBD,B00172BJ7I

second - size of the product.  1oz of this small plastic see through bottle which you will use in a month (or less is used diligently twice a day on face and neck) has a price tag of $33 which is quite steep.

this product is marketed as serum and has gel like consistency which is definitely a plus.  it is easily applied on the skin and it absorbs quickly.  this allows consumer to move on quickly to applying day cream and sunscreen (during daytime).

i gave this product 3 starts because the use of parabens did it for me. i will not pay any money for the product that uses this type of ingredient in their skincare line.  toxins already come free (from environments and processed foods and sugars).  why would i pay some skincare company money to poison me some more under pretense that herbal ingredient is ginseng.",2016-09-23,3,3,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B00172LM8O

6428,"mario badescu has been in the skin care business since 1967 and has, without doubt, developed an excellent reputation among both average consumers and celebrities alike. that said, the company is heralded for its acne fighting products, which doesn't mean their other lines, such as anti-aging go unrecognized. i was initially attracted to this herbal hydrating serum because since i've battled oily skin since adolescence, i like the fact that it could be used alone as a lightweight hydrator for oil skin. though, interestingly, and quite to the contrary, manufacturers also state that it is made for all types of skin... so go figure.

anyway, first and foremost, this tiny 1 ounce bottle of serum is on the expensive side, so you have high hopes that good skin results will be stacked in your favor. i like the gel consistency of the serum, the subtle blue color and, as far as the fragrance goes, i don't smell a thing. the serum is super absorbent and definitely doesn't add any additional oil to my face. as far as the effect it has on smoothing and enhancing my skin, that's questionable. for the price, i'd like to see the results, but, quite frankly, i haven't thus far. i've tested many serums over the years, and, everything considered, this one doesn't hit my top-10 list.",2016-09-17,3,3,A1NXA6Y1T9XDUM,B00172LM8O

i love la roche-posay as a skincare brand, but have had very mixed results with their makeup products. i have to say, though, this little gem is a win! i'd definitely recommend it!",2017-11-12,5,5,A3HZ687GB0AH7Y,B001NZ1OWO

with the eyeliner pencil, i've been majorly disappointed. why?
- the pigment is on the lower side
- one needs to apply the pencil really hard to get some color on the eye

the only good part is that it came off very easily, but then there was not enough pigment, to begin with.

6438,"for this product to glide on smoothly, be sure your eyelids are clean, dry and absolutely oil free.
otherwise the liner will tend to drag, and you will have to go over your lid several times.

i have used many brands of eyeliner.
i prefer the ease of application with liquid ones, and the look, but they can easily smudge before they are completely dry.

as far as this eyeliner pencil,  i find it to be about middle of the road as far as ease of application and staying power.
the pencil is soft, but it would glide more easily if it were a bit softer.
as promised, i find it does not irritate my eyes, but for me, that is not much of a problem anyway.
the liner stays on fairly well, but does smudge as the day goes on. however, because it is a soft pencil, the smudging almost looks deliberate,  giving your eyelids a smoky look at the lash line.",2018-01-11,4,3,A1QS1B2IW9SWHC,B001O1K3I8
6439,"the la roche-posay respectissime soft eyeliner pencil for sensitive eyes works fairly well.

i found this eyeliner to apply smoothly without the need to go over any one section multiple times. i applied this to both my upper and lower lash line before applying my mascara as recommended. the line i get is very smooth and not smudgy in any way.

when worn, i found it to fade after several hours. it took nothing but a quick redo to refreshen the look i desired to have. i feel this is best worn when it's dryer out and not when it's rainy all the time since this is not water-proof.

i had zero discomfort or dryness to my eyes after wearing for a long time. it has no smell that i can detect.

i like how easy it is to apply. the only issue i ran into was when i first received it and the huge pain it was to remove the packaging on the lid. once this packing is removed the plastic top is easy off and on but not so easy that it will just come off if tossed in a makeup bag or purse.

i found the black color to be a true black which is exactly what i wanted. it was no problem to remove with my favorite makeup removing wipes.

i had "heard" of skinmedica and seen the products at our dermatologist's office. promoted by oprah and featured in allure magazine.  however, my knowledge was very limited. so i began reading all the "information" i could find. (which everyone should do before using any kind of "fountain of youth product.") i was a bit taken-a-back by the idea of using 'foreskin' on my face. the idea was jarring, the facts not so much. yes they start with foreskin in the lab and 1 foreskin can be used in the fibroblast procedure for years!
so after the initial shock, i had to be totally, unapologetically honest and admit i would use almost any ingredient that could deliver a refreshed, more youthful look.

upon arrival: as pictured, it arrives in a black slip box. removing the box reveals the 1.0 ounce, single touch, dual dispense, product bottle with chrome colored cap, lightly attached to the base of the box. (simply wiggle the bottle slightly to remove it from the box bottom.)

i have used this product exclusively for 31 days. (the day i placed the order to try the tns essential serum i stopped my daily regiment of nerium products. this gave me 5 days in between.) before engaging the pump the first time, i lightly tapped the bottom of the bottle on the counter three times. holding it firmly and making sure to tap the bottle evenly. (as this was suggested  by my clinician, as well as, many websites.) i have not had any problem with the use or function of the bottle.

you can see from the pictures - with a single press of the button there are two products simultaneously released. . . one, off-white and lotiony-like. the second is crimson colored and gel-like. i dispensed one "pump" onto the back of my hand, mixed with my finger, and applied to my face, forehead, nose, and around my mouth. then a second pump for my jawline, neck, and decolletage.
it feels incredibly silky while applying. when i touched my face as it was drying, it felt sticky-ish. it takes up to 7 seconds to fully dry. then lightly touching/sweeping my face it feels soft, almost creamy-ish. that's a really nice feeling! there is an odor  - that i can best describe as slightly medicinal. it doesn't last long and definitely would not prevent me from using the product.

i am 47-years-old, was a sun lover, have two forehead frown lines, laugh/smile lines, and the dreaded "tired" or "hollowed" under eye issue. (thankfully i haven't battled acne in many years.) unfortunately i was not impressed with the tns serum. no, i did not expect a face transformation. but at 238$ an ounce and all the hype i did expect something more than the creamy feeling after application. i do think my liquid make-up looked smoother, which i really liked. but i can get the same result from a good face primer. (and it's a lot cheaper.) maybe you have to use this with other skinmedia products or maybe results take more than one bottle to get. (i had visable, noticeable results with my regular regiment the first week.)

like all skin revitalize, rejuvenate products individual results vary. this may be a miracle cream for some - it was simply so-so for me.

the sultra heats up quickly to 380 degrees which is both good and bad - helps make the curls longer lasting but reduces the margin for error when using. the sultra is easy to use with its 9 foot cord. the swivel cord makes handling behind the head much easier. the 1.5 size ceramic barrel is extremely smooth and makes large, beautiful curls. the included heat-resistant glove is a little unwieldy, but necessary to guide/hold your hair when working with the hot iron in the other hand.

the kit also includes an iron pad which works well to contain the hot iron. a bonus for travelers  it works from 110  240 volts.

6453,"i was quietly optimistic about these new serums. the directions were easy to follow:

apply s-1 & s-2 twice daily, apply s-3 only once (bedtime)
  wash & dry face/ neck area
apply approximately 5 drops of each, tapping/massaging the serum into the skin.
  starting with *s-1 (nourisher) features superfruit stemcells, moisturizes the skin, aids absorption
  step two: apply *s-2 (smoother) contains peptides targeting fine lines and wrinkles.
  evening:  apply *s-3 (lifter) contains hyaluronic acid and vitamin c, to plump and brighten.

i put my regiment on hold and used these products as directed. facial toning, smoothing, brightening and tightening are real concerns. we all want to rejuvenate our face...if not turn the clock back - slowing it down would be nice.

after using these serums for one month -
the lifter. *s-3 was my favorite. my skin felt tighter and it was brighter. i had a subtle glow again. using the three tiny bottles took some getting used too. this regiment took about 6 minutes longer than my usual. the serums were pleasant enough ...no foul odors or stickiness. the tiny dropper could be a problem for some. i would think nuface could repackage these serums so that reading, grasping and dispensing are easier. last, the price - i think it is high. based on my use it averages out to $15 a week. considering the results were no more effective than the product i have been using, i see no reason to change.

if you're considering a new product i definitely recommend this "starter set." it will give you ample time to evaluate your individual results, before investing in the larger, even more expensive bottles.",2016-07-19,3,4,A2IGQTQGWVL230,B005CX2DTQ

6455,"as a user of the nuface trinity electric current facial toning device, i was excited to try their new serums. included in this set are 3 sample sizes of 3 different serums. be warned- they are tiny at .25oz each! s1 is the 'nourisher' designed to moisturize skin and help it absorb the other serums. it features superfruit stemcells. s2 is the 'smoother' which contains peptides designed to smooth out fine lines and wrinkles. s3 is the 'lifter' which uses vitamin c and hyaluronic acid to brighten skin and plump it up.

use: directions state that you should massage 5 drops of each serum into your face and neck after washing your face. s1 and s2 are supposed to be used twice a day while s3 is used once a day. personally, i found the products made my skin too oily for makeup application if i used s1 and s2 in the morning so i only used s1-3 at night before going to bed.

effectiveness: the serums feel wonderful on your skin. it felt very nourished during use and even in the morning after washing my face. my skin seemed more moisturized within a few days of use. when i received the serums, i stopped my former regimen of moisturizer and vitamin c.  the results from those products (brightened skin and smoothed fine lines) were maintained with the use of nuface serums. my skin did gain a slightly dewy quality which it did not have before.

downside: the price of these serums is very high compared to generic products with similar ingredients and the same results. i did not see a difference between these serums and my normal regimen of moisturizer containing hyaluronic acid and vitamin c serum. (which has a price point of about $25 and lasts 5 months). for this reason, i suspect that s3 is the one that really delivers results since it has almost the same ingredients as my former regimen. i used the serums nightly for close to a month and used about 1/2 of each bottle. this puts the monthly cost at about $37. to purchase the serums individually you are looking at between $70-88 for 1oz.",2016-07-13,3,4,A1E3TWWRB1Q7CS,B005CX2DTQ

i have sensitive skin, and i am very pleased with the comfort of this product.

this is a sheer, versatile, comfortable, dewy tinted moisturizer type foundation.  natural finish, well suited to summer.  shades versatile and adapt well to skin.  dewy but not overly so.  natural looking foundation that doesn't dehydrate or irritate skin.  skin care grade ingredients.

6483,"i was pleasantly surprised by this stuff - i'd definitely pick some up again! i've been using it by itself some days, and it provides good coverage for a more natural/less overly made up look. it works really well under powder, too (i use jane iredale mineral powder). the color blends very naturally into my fair-complexioned/cool skin tone.

this stuff stays on really well throughout the day. you can tell it's going to last when you really have to scrub your hands with lots of soap and water after applying it just to get it off your hands!

my only concern here is that it ends up on my clothes if i brush against it while wearing - bad for white or dark colored clothing. so, careful there...

scent: not much of a scent, but it's not *great*. i'm very sensitive to smells, so i'm glad this isn't perfume-y. but it has a very light, almost chemical-y scent that i'm not a huge fan of. i think most people probably won't even notice it.

6488,"this product was a bit darker than i anticipated for the spot correction i wanted to use it for. however, i did test it out anyway and found that i liked the consistency of the product and it's blending abilities.

a lot of concealers (i'm guess ones with more moisture based on their beading) tend to blend out a bit if you have a really red pimple or area, but this one seems to retain its consistency and feathers more like a full foundation. i'm a bit unsure about its price to value ratio though as i have other products i like as well that are more robust in size with a lower impact on the pocketbook.

if you are using this regularly for undereyes, it will work well, but you will go through a container pretty quickly! fair warning.",2018-07-13,3,3,A16Z2OECAUX8Z4,B00FW6ZTW6

this isn't perfect, but it is the best concealer i've ever used.  i have to apply and blend to make the product cover without contrasting with my foundation. the coverage doesn't last through my day -- in and out of doors -- but at least i start the day looking great.

6493,"this is a small portion of concealer designed for spot coverage of blemishes, dark spots, or other skin imperfections. i will note that i tried it without foundation, but with a moisturizer applied to my skin to make application less difficult. my skin is thin, aging (i'm 53) and fairly sensitive (which is why i don't use foundation. my primary purpose in using this was to cover somewhat bluish dark spots under my eyes during allergy season.

i will note that my expectations of this product were high based on the price point. since it markets itself as being good for sensitive skin, i didn't expect that it would make my skin itchy after application and intermittently thereafter (but the worst in the 10 minutes or so after application). without foundation, i found that it was very difficult to blend it in in such a way that it wasn't obvious that there was a spot application of make-up under my eyes  at least if used in sufficient layers to actually provide some concealment. i guess the tone may not have been the best match for my skin color, but i'm not sure if any shade would have worked better. all in all, i was disappointed in the coverage and the feel.

besides the difficulty blending and the itchiness, i was somewhat disconcerted by the packaging, but not by how basic and cheap it was for a high profile product (though there was that, too as it's just a black tube with a plain-ish label on it). i was uncomfortable with the lack of any sort of seals on it at all. the box has no seal. the tube itself has no seal. it would be very easy for someone to tamper with the make-up and there would be no way to know what had happened.",2017-09-22,2,3,A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV,B00FW6ZTW6

6498,"this is so easy to apply if you need to get ready in a hurry - no liquid, no blending sponges, no foundation brushes. i would take 10 minutes every afternoon before my husband got home to pat on some of this powder to make myself a little more presentable after wrangling babies all day. please keep in mind - i say powder because it is a powder, but it's a powder foundation. you can use it on its own, but in order to prevent transferring or break down, you need a good setting spray applied over this. i have applied it by itself, but as a result i've experienced transferring when i did so. another benefit of powder foundation is that you are much less likely to see product pilling, which is when your product balls up on your skin. this often happens when you're applying more than one layer without letting it absorb thoroughly or if you're applying too large an amount.

coverage is great, and you can easily build to a full even application. this applies with a round sponge pad, and there's a pretty good amount in the pan. dermablend is a professional brand, and for good reason. it's pretty high quality makeup - i believe i first came across it years ago in a tattoo magazine article or letters section for a future bride who needed to cover a tattoo on her wedding day. it's good stuff, and i like that at this point in time, it's possible for the average consumer to get products like this without being a professional or having a connection.",2018-06-18,5,4,A1C21QBAZ1W4Z2,B00H2VO6P0

i love the way this makeup minimizes pores!  somehow, there's enough substance to address large pores without any caking in the fine lines and wrinkles on my face.  that's a hard combination to find.

6501,"i've been using dermablend for years but had never tried this powder -- and i can't believe what i was missing. i've used and loved both the liquids like flawless creator and the solids like cover creme, but nothing from dermablend or any other company has ever covered messed-up spots as fast or as flawlessly as this powder. when i have a horrible zit or a red, rough patch or anything else that is not only discolored but has a different texture from the rest of my face, this is what i reach for. i put just a bit on one corner of the included sponge and just dab it on the spot and it's gone. and it's totally opaque, and best of all it's matte and because it's powder it doesn't settle into grooves or accentuate rough skin; it just sits on top and conceals everything. the first time i used it i was in such bad shape and i had to go to a client meeting, and when i tried this i nearly cried with relief. i hope you're never so desperate, but if you are, may you know the reassurance of having this on hand.

here's a tip to make sure that this is really invisible on your skin: if you don't know your dermablend color, order a free sample kit from dermablend's site before you order. you can't trust your monitor's colors and color matching is very precise with dermablend, so it's critical to get it right.",2018-05-20,5,5,A1G60ANYI0HMEU,B00H2VO6P0

i use a  brush to apply and a blender sponge to even things out and blend the last bits. then after this, just a blender for any concealer and a standard fluffy brush for blush after this. i use a bit of setting powder, and i'm done till usually mid-afternoon when i touch a few spots up with my blender and take an oil sheet to my face.

6526,"with body creams, i do like to splurge a little.  i want a nice scent and a non greasy feeling.  typically, i would go to back and body works for this type of product but i have a love of the scents listed and i was hoping for something more natural and less fake-fragrance chemical smelling.  this fit the bell - a really love scent combined with moisturizing that you can actually see immediately.  skin softens and looks less tight right after the first use.",2018-08-23,4,3,A2WW57XX2UVLM6,B01CP39HMG
6527,"this is a nice, thick, moisturizing body cream. it goes on smooth and leaves skin silky, although it does not soak in all the way and leaves a residue behind. it has what i would describe as a "tropical fruity" fragrance that tends to linger and can become clawing. it comes in a fancy-looking tub with a wood-looking cover and a plastic bottom that makes it look bigger than it's actual 7.4 fl oz. i wouldn't buy this again for the price that it's offered, but there's nothing inherently wrong with it.",2018-08-22,3,3,A1M3CSHV1X9PAS,B01CP39HMG
6528,"i keep planning to move this to the bathroom for an after-shower body cream, but so far it hasn't made it out of my home office, where i use it as a hand cream because i enjoy the fragrance so much (the fragrance is very strong, so beware if you're not a fan of indian rose). it has kind of an odd, slick feeling initially, but it absorbs completely and leaves my hands soft and silky, not as if they're coated with something. a small amount goes a long way, and it really does make me pause and just enjoy the moment. the jar also looks attractive on my desk.",2018-08-20,5,5,A1BTG38XSGYLW3,B01CP39HMG
6529,"the eucalyptus and rosemary combination have a soothing and penetrating quality.  this cream feels as if it is nourishing your skin.

the scent is a trifle exotic, but not too strong for me.  a little goes a long way.  i used it on my hands and body and it felt good.

it isn't greasy.  it is more creamy.  and it lasts on your skin.

it does feel like something you would have put on your skin after a massage.

it very much softens your skin.  it seems like a quality product which is good for your skin.",2018-08-14,5,5,A1GQAKL9CGQLP1,B01CP39HMG
6530,"fantastic body cream, that i mostly use on my hands. the best part is the smell - divine!",2018-08-14,5,5,A33HIV8RXRDM88,B01CP39HMG
6531,"i am very particular about the lotion i use. i have a low tolerance for greasy lotion. this lotion is not at all.  it smells amazing (!) and it dries without any greasiness. the scent is not overpowering but has a nice flowery smell. despite the higher end price, it's worth it. a little goes a long way so it will last a couple months at least with daily use.",2018-08-13,5,4,AP9Z703TP9YCM,B01CP39HMG
6532,"the ritual of sakura body cream is a medium weight hydrating cream with a eucalyptus scent.  the scent is suitable for a man or a woman.  it has a mild eucalyptus type of scent mixed with a baby powder scent.  i notice the benefits of this cream anywhere i have chosen to apply it.  my skin both looks and feels hydrated after application.
  i have used the cream on my decolletage and noticed that keeps my skin soft and silky.  it provides wonderful hydration to dry feet and heels.  it soaks into dry areas and seals the top layer keeping my skin soft all day.  if you are looking for a wonderful spa gift for yourself or someone you love this cream is an excellent choice.",2018-08-13,4,5,A36U7QMYILRLSW,B01CP39HMG
6533,"i love this scrub!  it smells so good and it feels fantastic on my skin.  leaves it so silky smooth.  i would definitely recommend it and i will be buying it again!",2018-09-24,5,5,AUEW0SKOB1XYF,B01CP39FL4
6534,"i use this scrub to wash my face in the evening, and really enjoy it.  the scent is amazing, i find it masculine which works for me.  i like the size of the particles, not too small and not too big.  they are easy to work across the skin, others i have tried seem to dissolve too quickly.  it does a great job of cleaning the oils from my skin and leaves it feeling great.  i'd highly recommend this scrub.",2018-09-23,5,5,A3RGHO0Q938FRS,B01CP39FL4
6535,"i like body scrub for my elbows hands and feet. i usually use a coconut one with a mild fragrance. this has a very strong fragrance - too strong. and it stays with you for a while. in a shower - not a small one - i found the fragrance overwhelming. i don't like it at all. as far as scrubbing, yes it works. but it is very liquidy. not as salty as i'd like.",2018-09-12,2,3,A1DG75OT3Y49EM,B01CP39FL4
6536,"when i take long baths, i like to scrub on my legs and get all the dead skin off.  this body scrub smells so refreshing and i scrubbed on my legs after soaking the bath for ten minutes.  the exfoliating worked well but wasn't too rough - i used a loofah in addition to the scrub and then just rubbed around my ankles and knees for a little longer.",2018-08-31,5,3,A39ANVSTOM4L6H,B01CP39FL4
6537,"very strong eucalyptus scent, almost overpowering. it's refreshing at time of use, but i don't want to go around smelling like that all day. it does have sort of a warming sensation, which is not what i want in the summer. could be okay for cold winter days if you love eucalyptus.
nondescript scrub otherwise.",2018-08-31,3,5,ALBW2ZBS6Z2AY,B01CP39FL4
6538,"i love the smell of eucalyptus.  this leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  it helps remove the dead skin while the scent is refreshing.  price is a little high, but it is a big jar.",2018-08-21,4,5,A1M92239OM8KPO,B01CP39FL4
6539,"this is an interesting product and the first time i've used a sugar scrub.  it feels great on the skin and provides and nice, fresh, clean feel.  the smell is just ok.  i prefer an essential oil, natural type smell for spa things, and this one has more of synthetic smell that while not offensive, is not my favorite either.",2018-08-16,4,4,A3A5XNAM3ZW7Z6,B01CP39FL4
6540,"while i initially kind of scoffed at this, thinking is was sort of hippie, i figured why not try it? my skin isn't sensitive, and i like using scrubs anyway.
after a few tries, i've come to really love this scrub. it's salt, so it doesn't melt before i'm done with it, like sugar scrubs. it really scrubs off all the dead skin that accumulates, especially along the back of my arms, and leaves everything feeling super smooth. the oil leaves my skin feeling that way for days afterwards, although i'm glad the smell doesn't hang around. this smells strongly of mint and eucalyptus, which is very pleasant in the shower, and opens up my airways. i love the feeling actually. the smell hangs around for a few hours, so i use this at night so it doesn't compete with my perfume. it leaves the bathroom smelling nice as well.
this is actually a great product, one which i'd recommend for anybody looking for a decent scrub.",2018-08-14,5,5,A2X3L31KCXBHCL,B01CP39FL4
6541,"sweet orange & cedar wood
i love this fragrance & get compliments every time i wear it.
the first thing my daughter said was that this smelled so good on me & she said it was a happy fragrance.
it really surprised me that she used that term, she's never used an emotion to describe a fragrance before.  i told her that's the perfect description because it's advertised as a happy, uplifting scent.
i love it & have purchased more for myself & bought some for gifts too.",2018-09-23,5,5,A1PI8VBCXXSGC7,B01CP39M4O
6542,"this has a beautiful orange and woody smell and lightness to the spray. it holds it smell for a few hours and is not over powering. i've gotten a few different items from rituals brand and i've been quite impressed with the quality.",2018-09-13,4,5,AP9Z703TP9YCM,B01CP39M4O
6543,"this body spray has a warm delicious scent.  it sprays on nicely.  it is a spray oil but it's light, not heavy or thick.",2018-09-06,5,5,A1RZ0J2CZZJOTX,B01CP39M4O
6544,"some perfumes or body sprays have a cloying, headache inducing scent. this is light, lovely, and refreshing. it smells clean although it does not last all day. the cedar scent is lighter than expected, which is nice, and is much stronger on the orange smell.",2018-09-05,4,5,A3VGAP2KLCBNBB,B01CP39M4O
6545,"this is a very nice spray bottle and i love the brand. i have used quite a few products by this brand and so far, they have not disappointed me. the smell of this is nice but a bit too strong for hot weather. i prefer to use this in my house as an air freshener. it smells very nice and doesn't have that cheap scent like most room sprays.",2018-08-30,4,4,AK9XE112RZO6Q,B01CP39M4O
6546,"lovely, fruity scent. the description says "sweet orange and cedar wood" but i would say the orange is definitely stronger. it only takes a single spray to give you that lovely scent. i like using it on my damp hair. the scent will linger for quite some time after my hair dries. it also makes a good body spray.",2018-08-27,4,5,AGA7LFNS3YUXC,B01CP39M4O
